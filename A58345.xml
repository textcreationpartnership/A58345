            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ventured upon a great work, I do need a Patron; I beſeech you, be you mine, and the Citie's. The Subject, I know, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpleaſe you; it is about a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent City, and Gods pleading for it, to have it ſpared. Would it not be your comfort, to ſee your City thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Would it not be your joy, to behold it thus ſecured? Yes; your vertue, I know, doth deſire the repentance of it; and your zeal, the ſafety of it. Who knowes, but the motion may take place? God, of Stones, can raiſe up Children to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the Womb of the Barren may be fruitfull. This City, which hath learned little by
<pb facs="tcp:96669:3"/>Pulpits, may learn much by a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</p>
            <p>I have prepared the Piece, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and amplified it much, ſince the firſt drawing or preaching of it; that I might make it as exact, as mine Art would attain to. I deſire to preſent it, by your fair and ſpotleſſe hand, to your City; The innocency and piety of ſuch a tried Citizen, may do much, to promove my intention, and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Work.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Do call you out to a new Merchandize; Many of you have been negotiating in moſt of the known Cities of the world; but did ever any of you yet trade at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh?</hi> This is that which I deſire may be your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pory, that ye would buy up h r commodities, and ſet up an Exchange of her Wares: let others call upon you to mind your Traffique elſwhere, I direct you to this City. Some of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s aſhes, ſackcloth, beaſts in new skins, men with new lips, feet, and hands, would be more uſeful to you, than all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Rarities which the richeſt Marts upon earth can afford you. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> is the place, the way is beaten out for you, I have choſen you out a good <hi>Leader,</hi> (a Gentleman of intemerate fame, and unblemiſhed reputation); be not unwilling, nor aſhamed to follow him. My inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy hath been moſt with him, and I have been very privy to his worth, therefore let it be no mans diſpleaſure, or regret, that I (according to my acquaintance and affection,) do ſingle out him to ſtand in the front of this new Company to be erected. Though I love and honour him, yet I have an high opinion of many of you; therefore I have made bold to ſummon forth Him, and You, to try if ye can by your joint inquiry find out the place, and ſtrike up a bargain for that memorable merchandize; be not offended to go together like Pilgrims, ye ſhall never repent you of the journey, for ye go to viſit a renowned place, in whoſe ruines ye may find treaſure enough to redeem you out of preſent hazards, and to prevent future miſeries: Indeed I lay your Sandals before you, yet be not diſcouraged, ye ſhall go but like Merchant-Adventurers; and if ye be induſtrious, and employ your time well, ye may drive a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageable trade; if ye can but find out the place, and come home laden with the riches of the ſame, your City was never ſo happy as ye ſhall make it; linger not in the journey, but ſet forth ſpeedily, and make a quick return, and millions ſhall bleſſe you. Onely do not quarrell as ye go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, fall not out by the way, who ſhall go firſt, or who ſhall come after, but walk on peaceably, and God Almighty proſper you. <hi>Abraham</hi> when
<pb facs="tcp:96669:4"/>he went up to <hi>Moriah</hi> to ſacrifice, he left the beaſts at the bottom of the Mountain; ſo do ye, all envy and emulation, when ye are going upon this noble deſign. Ye have more to think on, than the frivolous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous cavils of nature. Apply your ſelves to the right work, and fall to right-down Chriſtianity. Let him be the beſt man, which can be moſt vertuous and zealous in this religious ſervice. It is an hard thing to build an City; and it will be as hard a thing to preſerve it. When a City is grown crazy with ſins, they muſt be Maſter-workmen which can repair the decayes of it, or keep it from a downfall: if ye be never ſo well prepared, yet ye have a task which doth require almoſt an Angelicall purity and perfection to diſcharge it. Eye your duty, and look upon nothing elſe, and ſee what a great meaſure of remorſe and reformation is expedient to keep a tottering City from an imminent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty. Oh go not to <hi>Nineveh</hi> onely to look upon the City, for then this motion will take no impreſſion upon you, and ye will never take off the charge of my impreſſion, but theſe Books must go ſeek for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Country, which will neither be for your honour, nor for my advantage; but come ye home full fraught with <hi>Ninevehs</hi> qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I ſhall be happy, and ye bleſſed. Conſider what ye are to do, to wring a ſpeare out of the hand of the Almighty, to turn back an hoſt of judgements upon their March; appear in your compleat har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and quit your ſelves like men. But by what Citizens ſhall this be performed? by them which are truly religious, and are ſenſible of the ſins, and do ſupplicate for the ſafety of the City. There are many which are called Citizens, and many that ſeem to be Religious; but I muſt have ſuch as have a ſenſe, and can ſupplicate, which have the ſins of the City ſmarting in their hearts, and the ſafety of the City ecchoing in their lips.

Such are the conſpicuous perſons, which are perſpicuous in graces, and the eyes that ſee them bleſſe them for their piety, whoſe chief mart is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and trade for ſuch riches as exceed all the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe hearts are knit to the City, and whoſe tongues are ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it, which weep over the ſins of the City, and would even ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice themſelves in expiatory duties to prevent judgements from it. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me therefore, if I do not judge the City by Furs, and gold Chains, birth and bruit, port and portalls, means and merchandiſe; no, not by wit and worſhip, ſermons and ſervices; but by ſoft breſts, ſound vitalls, pure and operative ſpirits. Potency, priority, principality, preſidency, here have no place, but onely the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience, and the fervent Soul.

To obtain this bleſſing, I confeſſe I have (as I can) ſanctified my ſelf with ſome ſolemn reſolutions; I deſire you to enter into the Vow with me, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the City with your repentance, and devotions, till a diſcharge may be brought out of Heaven, and the City ſetled in a condition to be <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> I hear a lowd ſpeech, <hi>What is not this City able to do?</hi> I wiſh it may be able to examine, and to extricate her ſelf. I cannot but love your City for her breſt, that ſhe proved ſuch a kind Nourſe to them, which had neither milk nor maintenance, when upon the death of their Mother they were as expoſed children. All the gratitude which I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, is to piety this Nourſe upon her ſick-Couch, and if I can, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her alive upon her bed of anguiſhing; till there may be ſome ſignes of her recovery I ſhall not ceaſe to viſit her, and, (if ſhe will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me) he as a ghoſtly Father to her, that ſhe may confeſſe her inward diſeaſe, and apply that ſpirituall remedy which will certainly, and can onely work her proper cure. I thought once to have called in all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Gentry of the Nation to joyn in this work; for the <hi>Heralds</hi> office is in the City; and why ſhould not they <hi>which are comparable to fine gold,</hi> caſt in their talent for the advance of this pious deſign?

I
<pb facs="tcp:96669:5"/>would have ſummoned-in all the Phyſitians to administer a ſoveraign potion to this City; for their Colledge being within her walles, and they having raiſed vaſt eſtates out of their City practiſe, why ſhould not they prepare an Elixir for her out of their ſuppled eyes, rent-heartſtrings extracted conſciences, to preſerve her at an exigent? yea, I thought once to have ſent down to all the Cities in the Kingdome, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired hither their ſelves, or to have ſent their faithfull ſubſtitute, Proxey, their converſion, to officiate for the City in her greateſt perill. For ſeeing this is the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> why ſhould not all the Daughters do their duty to their Mother, and wait upon her with their prayers, and tears, and humiliation, and mortification? yes, they here ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their commodities, and buying here all their principall wares, it is convenient that they ſhould bleſſe her with their repentance, which hath bleſſed them with revenue. But becauſe the moſt proper cure is that which is perſonall (people being able to prepare their Antidote) therefore ye knowing both the malady, and the medicine, what need I trouble others, when ye are able (if ye will) to do the work your ſelves, and to be your own Phyſitians: And now that I have left you in your own hands, <hi>ſetting Life and Death before you,</hi> oh that I could ſpeak to the City in generall, that as all <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſo all your City would be unaninous to unite their repentance to keep off a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Therefore I ſet, by all the humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vicious amongſt you, and apply my ſelfe onely to thoſe which are truly religious, which have the moſt conſcience to diſcover ſin, and the moſt remorſe to reconcile an offended God.

All ye then which are of mine own Religion, and repentance, be ye my Patrones out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the Cities out of relation; deny not your own City, nor me, for your Cities ſake; this ſhall be my engagement, and I hope not the Cities envy; that I ſhould deſire you to do that for the City, which the City will not do for it ſelfe. I cannot expect you to be abſolute Saints; I my ſelfe am not innocent, but I deſire to be penitent, and I beſceech you let us both center together in this qualification. Make this ſubject, if ye can, your Altar, where ye may work an attonement; or your <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> where ye may find refuge, howſoever make it your <hi>Crucifix,</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,

I know a man which hath wrought ſome miracles in the world, but yet his conſcience doth more rejoyce in his repentance, then in all the teſtimonies of Gods power, yea then in the finger of divine Omnipotency lent unto him to make him inſtrumental in admired events. Whatſoever your gifts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downments, characteriſticall, or chariſmaticall priviledges be, yet feel it as your chief conſolation, and write it down as your prime preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that God hath cauſed the lips of them that were aſleep to ſpeak, that the eyes of the blind do ſee out of obſcurity, that ye ſtand up from the dead, and have ſorrowed to repentance. <hi>Rejoyce not in theſe things, but rejoyce that your names are written in heaven.</hi> Let others look to be Scient, but look ye to be Penitent. Lord, who am <hi>I, that I ſhould go unto</hi> Pharoah, and that <hi>I ſhould bring forth the children of Iſrael out of Egypt?</hi> Exod. <hi>3.11.</hi> So, who am I, that I ſhould ſummon a whole City to repentance, and bring ſuch vaſt numbers out of the bondage of their corruptions and deſtruction? yet God hath given the motion, and he may by ſuch a ſtammering tongue, make his meſſage effectuall. Who knows, but that this Cake of barley bread may overthrow the tent of the <hi>Midianites?</hi> that this lump of dry figs may heal the ſore? that this clay and ſpittle by the bleſſing of God, may open the eyes of the blind? I venture therefore upon the work, and call forth you as my Aſſiſtants in the enterprize; Bring forth your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and what may not ſuch an <hi>Heſter</hi> appearing do to reverſe a Decree? God is not ſo offended with the City, but Repentance can yet end the distaſt. To aſſure you of this, I ſet before you <hi>Nineveh,</hi> not halfe ſo glorious in being a Potent, as in being a poenitent people; they are poenitent, and God is inſtantly aſſwaged. Will ye obſerve the ſum of the paſſage, if I do but lead you into the City? there are very delectable things at the entrance, even between the Prophet and God. Do ye love a Prophet truly? then here is <hi>Jonah</hi> active in his pertinent
<pb facs="tcp:96669:6"/>duty, a weighty errand? Do ye honour God faithfull? then here is God buſied about his proper work, a work of mercy. What more conſonant to the Prophet, then to impart his Maſters mind? What more congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, then to interpret his own meaning? <hi>Jonah</hi> doth denounce a judgement, God doth pronounce a pardon, the Prophet muſt not ſpare and yet God doth ſpare. The Prophet had threatned them into repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then God doth not threaten, but comfort; not adjudge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe, but accept and acquit. Repentance hath renewed the people, and revoked the ſentence. It is true, the Prophet was very oppoſite to it, but God doth bring in very appoſite reaſons to ſatisfie his contradicting ſpirit. God doth plead for the City, and doth plead againſt his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. He doth ſhew him how the Prophet cannot be juſtified, without menacing an overthrow, and how God cannot be justified, without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring this overthrow. This is the <hi>Dilemma</hi> how the Prophecie may ſtand, and the City may ſtand. The Prophecie is obeyed, and therefore there could be no overthrow; there was repentance, and therefore there cannot be rejection, and revenge; this is the middle way, which God doth make uſe of to anſwer the <hi>Dilemma.</hi> God will not approve of his Prophets, if they do not proclaim judgement: God will not liſten to his Prophets, if they do declaim againſt repentance. Though the Prophets muſt thunder, yet God doth keep the thunder-bolt in his own hand. A ſinfull people muſt be warned, a penitent people muſt not be deſtroyed. No, this is one of the Riddles of Gods mercy, which <hi>Jonah</hi> not being able to unfold, God doth expound it; yea, the whole debate is about the reſolving of this difficult demur. God doth ſhew to <hi>Jonah</hi> how he could propheſie no leſſe, and yet how he himſelf could ſpare no leſſe. <hi>Shouldſt not thou thus cry? Should not they thus reform? Should not I thus ſpare?</hi> God had taught <hi>Jonah</hi> many things, and now he doth reveal to him the aenigma of his mercifull juſtice; how juſtice and mercy can meet together in the ſame ſubject without violation to either: The Prophet at firſt was in a great blindneſſe concerning this ſecret, and the City had like to have paid dearly for his want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But God hath ſatisfied the doubt; and ſaved the City. <hi>Nineveh</hi> hath repented, &amp; <hi>Pergameae jam fas eſt parcere genti:</hi> It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite now that <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould be ſpared. So that I truſt neither <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi> cry, nor Gods plea, the courage of the one, nor the compaſſion of the other, the meſſage, nor the mercy, the Prophets ſcruple, or Gods ſcrutiny, the Prophets dark eye, or Gods bright mouth, <hi>Nineveh's</hi> ſacrifice, or <hi>Nineveh's</hi> ſafety, <hi>Nineveh's</hi> repentance, or <hi>Nineveh's</hi> remedy; the change of the City, or the change of the ſentence, the compunction, or compaſſion, the threatning, or the ſparing ſhall be diſpleaſing ſubjects to you. No, be ye Patrones to this Riddle, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of <hi>Jonah,</hi> the replication of God, the explication of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem. Oh that we could ſee ſuch a Riddle in your City, and thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. <hi>Jonah</hi> doth cry, but is God believed? the overthrow is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, but do men fly from is? the City is warned, but is it humbled?

As intelligent as this City doth ſeem to be, I wiſh it could anſwer one queſtion. Is it <hi>Nineveh?</hi> Is there expreſſion? or almoſt expectation of ſuch humbling and cleanſing? For this end is this cry ſent forth, and oh that the Prophet might onely cry, or the Prophet ſo cry, that he might cry up a <hi>Nineveh!</hi> Be ye not deafe, and open the cares of others; that ye may not be my Patrones on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of the City; not of her ſinnes, but of her repentance. If ye fail in this work, the City is paſt remedy. Be ye your felves therefore as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent as ye can, and diffuſe your repentance to others; have ye bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened conſciences, and draw others to feel the weight of thoſe guilts which may ſink them into ruine. The City is in perill, what is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative? Policy may invent many expedients for ſecurity, but I doe know none but that of repentance. To prevent a generall overthrow, ſhall we ever ſee a generall converſion? What will men leave their ſeats of honour, and apply their ſelves to ſack-cloth, aſhes, faſting, mighty cryes, turning from their evill waies, and from the violence of their hands? Oh that we could ſee ſuch a beautifull City to honour our Nation, and bleſſe it ſelfe. But I am afraid that this is but a City of deſires, and that it is not harder to build up Jeruſalem againe in her firſt glory, than to raiſe up ſuch a City amongſt us; every ſtone in this City may ſooner be altered, and new laid, rather than mens mindes and conſciences. I doubt whether penitent duties were ever truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended amongſt us, and I am very jealous whether ever or no we ſhall ſee them really expreſſed. Men can rather ſhoot the gulfe, climbe the Alpes, go a pilgrimage over the whole earth, than repent. Well, as it is my drift to propoſe, impoſe, and diſpoſe, ſo let it be yours to explore at homt, and excite abroad; Oh to incline God to plead with his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſaying, <hi>Should not I ſpare this great City, wherein are more then ſixſcore thouſand perſons, which cannot diſcern between their right hand, and their left hand, and alſo much cattel?</hi> That the Citizens could firſt plead with their conſciences, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Should not we turn to that great God, who hath invited us by more then ſixſcore thouſand warnings, which cannot diſcern between pitty and forgiveneſſe, and alſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance?</hi> Ye ſee now what a great task ye are to undertake, and that ye had need to lay to your whole ſtrength to bring forth a right City. Is it an eaſie matter for your ſelves to ſpeak this language, and to feel theſe breſt-motions? howſoever, is it ſo to open other mens lips, and to ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hearts on working? All the difficulties which ye ever met withall upon earth, are not like unto this ſtreight. Yet to what end do ye wait upon the Lord, if ye will not do him this ſervice? Why are ye trees of righteouſneſſe, if ye will not bring forth this fruit? I hope ye are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
<pb facs="tcp:96669:7"/>to God your ſelves, (yea, that there are ſome of the regenerate race, which doe ſtir quick in this City) but how many dead carkaſſes doe ye walk amongſt? I truſt that ye have brought iniquity to remembrance; but are there not too too many that need their Monitours and Remembrancers, as if they had forgotten their ſelves, and their ſins? In what forwardneſſe is the great work? is not the firſt ſtone for the generality yet to be laid? yes, it would astoniſh a man, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many celeſtiall ſhewes, there ſhould be ſo little heaven; and that the Devill ſhould be lurking under ſo many Angelicall transformations. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, here doth appear to be much Religion in the City, but what Repentance is there? or if Repentance, is it that of <hi>Nineveh?</hi> No, here are ſins enough in the City to have it overthrown, but is there repentance enough in it to have it ſpared? What people are, they may find out by examination, what they ſhould be, they may find out by the <hi>Example.</hi> The earth never ſaw greater provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but when ſhall it be ſaid, that the heavens never ſaw greater propitiation?

For I doe not ſee that men have learned <hi>Nineveh's</hi> initiating, much leſſe then her complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting graces: They are not yet come to her dejections, trepidations, perculſions, aſtoniſhments, humi-cubations, macerations, ſyncopes of griefe, paroxiſms of conflicts, gravitoned accents of prayer. No, people nouriſh the fleſh, catch at the world, follow modes, temporiſe with changes, and leave perills to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and judgments to the chance: Happen what wil, they have not ſo much as a wrimpled brow, or a trembling breast. A Stork will flie faſter from a cold Country, or a beaſt from a naked ſword, then theſe from plagues and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:96669:8"/>Then, if they be not come to the disfigured face of repentance, how will they ever come to her transfigured ſpirit? When ſhall we ſee the two eſſentiall parts of repentance amongſt them, <hi>The turning from their evill waids, and from the violence of their hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Their evill waies do ſeem to have a miſt upon them, they have not eyes clear enough to ſee them, or hearts tender enough to lament them: Though they have ſtrayed far enough from the preſcript rule of obedience, &amp; they find never a precept warranting their lawleſſe paths; yet, they do tread on, and conſider not whither their feet do carry them; the <hi>Ignis erraticus</hi> hath led them aſide, and they do not lay to heart over what ditches, rocks, cliffs, and precipices they do paſſe: It is enough that they are in motion, but whether in regular, or erroneous courſes, they do not apprehend. Oh that there ſhould be ſuch decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, under the directing Ordinances; or ſuch foot-prints, amongſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Chriſtians! <hi>No man ſaith, What have I done?</hi> Many a man ſaith, What may <hi>I</hi> not do? but, <hi>No man ſaith, What have I done?</hi> People do look upon their faces, but ſeldome upon their conſciences; this claſped book hath not been opened, to view every leafe; nor this deep well ſearched to the bottom, theſe many years. Oh! how much hypocriſie, apoſtacy, bribery, flattery, blood, blaſphemy, ſouth-ſaying, ſacrilege, have been paſt over without the leaſt check, or fret? Mens proper rights they can conſider, but not their proper ſins: no, If any ſins come under their diſcovery, or diſquiſition, they are the ſins of the age, or the ſins which malignity have doomed ſins, or the ſins of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Turky:</hi> but they have neither eyes, nor tongues, nor hearts, to ſpie out, ſpeak out, or reflect upon their proper ſins; though they be as bitter as gall, as red as ſcarlet, as venomous as the poyſon of the Aſpes, as black as Sathan, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth with a ſteam out of the ſmoak of the bottomleſſe pit; yet, there is neither ſenſibleneſſe, nor conſcientiouſneſſe of them: they are their proper ſins, and as they have given them conception and birth, ſo they will beſtow upon them education and maintenance: They may have a ſtreet-cry, or a Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe (ſometimes of them) but the ſound of them is gone, ſo ſoon as it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: they deny them, conceal them, extenuate them, and juſtifie them; yea, ſome are ſo impudent, as to deride them. <hi>Fooles make a mock of ſin,</hi> though it be to dance before a Cafe of their melting, or to triumph over a captivated <hi>Sampſon,</hi> or to quaffe in the Bowles of the Sanctuary, or to preſent <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> head in a platter, or to cry <hi>Hail</hi> to the King of the Jewes, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> leading away to be crucified. Theſe, and the like, are the expreſſions, which they do make to their ſins, rather then to look agaſt upon them, loath them, bleed under them. How many ſinners have ye yet ſeen, that though they have done things contrary to the Torch-light of Nature, the Sun-light of Scripture, the tenour of their own oaths, and the terrour of a Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them, that have yet bluſhed, or ſobbed, or wrung an hand, or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a knee for them? No, they have done them, and they ſtand up in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them; after production, they do beſtow upon them protection: there is either ſilence or ſenſleſneſſe, ſpeechleſſeneſſe or remorſleſneſſe. Now if people will not diſcern their ſins, how will they ever diſclaim them? if they will not look upon their evill wayes, how will they ever <hi>turn from their evill waies?</hi> What little likelyhood, what ſmall hopes of converſion and reformation?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The turning from the violence of the hands,</hi> is a thing as
<pb facs="tcp:96669:8"/>improhable; for, are there any gentler, or juſter times to be expected? Will men pare their nails, ſoften their harſh palms? No, <hi>I</hi> do not ſee ſo much as a ſenſe of injury, or a ſhame of oppreſſion; not ſo much as an <hi>Adonibezek</hi>'s remorſe for cruelty, to confeſſe, <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, having their thumbs and toes cut off, gathered meat under my table, Judg. 1.7.</hi> Nor an <hi>Ahab</hi>'s fright upon a bloody fact, to be confounded ſo, that perſons ſhould <hi>rend their clothes, put on ſackcloth, and go ſoftly, 1 King. 21.27.</hi> People do not ſo much as queſtion their Eſtates, which they have gotten by forged cavillation, or ask forgivneſſe for their wrongs, or make reſtitution for their ill gotten goods; much leſſe will they then deſiſt from their damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying courſes. Tyranny doth flow in with an high rage, <hi>The earth is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with violence, as it was in the daies of Noah, Gen. 6. 9.</hi> A man would think, that <hi>Aegypt</hi>'s iron furnace, or <hi>Babylon</hi>'s iron yoak were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. Here is digging of pits, taking up all with the Angle, ſwallowing people alive as the grave, eating fruits without mony, breaking the armes of the fatherleſſe, afflicting God's heritage, the Rulers being as roaring Lions, (as the Scripture ſaith) and the Judges as the Woolves of the evening, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with ſuch fury, that they leave not the bones tiil the morrow. Some groping for bribes, with <hi>Felix;</hi> ſome requiring mens right eyes, to condeſcend to a peace, with <hi>Naaſh;</hi> ſome pronounting ſentence of death, upon a framed information, with <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s Judges; yea, ſome not being aſhamed, to run greedily after the errour of <hi>Balaam</hi> for reward. How many houſes are built with crying ſtones, and cemented with bloody morter? The <hi>Times</hi> are full of much fraud and force, invention and circumvention, domination and concul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Men enjoying preyes with as much inward ſatisfaction, as birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights, and poſſeſſing rifles with as quiet a conſcience, as juſt earnings. Oh! when will the whip depart out of this City? when will the wild beaſt's teeth fall out of their heads? when will the hammers leave beating, or the mill-ſtones leave grinding? when will repentance ſo reduce the City to equity, that there need neither Tribunall to rectifie injuries, or Pulpit, to touch conſcience for extortion? People in generall will ſcarce take notice of their cruelty, much leſſe will they take away the crime; they will ſcarce feel their rough hands, much leſſe will they <hi>turn from the violence of their hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then ye ſee, how your City is in a dangerous, deplorable ſtate, full of ſtupendious ſins, and yet full of ſtupid impenitency; a profeſſing City, and yet far from Evangelicall purity; a corrupt Citty, and yet far from contrite <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh.</hi> How then may your City walls ſhake, and every Citiſens heart be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, expecting ſome unexemplified judgment, for theſe enormous tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Will God ever be dared with challenging treſpaſſes, or mocked with pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick formalities? Will the noiſe of your Sermon-bells, or the ſound of your Goſpelliſing tongues, be able to pacifie an incenſed God? No, he may ſeaze upon you in your ſtreets, where ye are defying him in your full ſtrength; or take you at Church, where ye are deluding him (perhaps) with Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedis. Will a few ſuperficiall ſpecious pretences, ſatisfie the strict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the God of pure eyes? No: <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man; what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee;</hi> not burn offerings, or calves of a year old, not thouſands of rams; or ten thouſand rivers of oyle, not thy firſt-born for thy tranſgreſſion, or the fruit of thy body for the ſin of
<pb facs="tcp:96669:9"/>thy ſoul; all theſe are but outward, they come no neerer to thee than thy cattel, thy ſtock, or thy progeny: thou muſt therefore be the burnt offering, the calf of a year old, the ram, the jar of oyl, the firſt-born, and the expiating fruit of the body; God muſt have thy ſelfe, thy ſelfe humbled or hated, thy ſelf renewed or rejected. There is nothing will appeaſe <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but the bringing of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin;</hi> there is nothing will attone God, but repentance, all by-contrivments are but ſiniſter drifts and bents. Ye ſee how <hi>Nineveh</hi> was ſpared, and ſo muſt ye be freed. Oh! that ye can think to ſtand an age in remorſleſneſſe, or to be ſecure one year in impenitency. No, the twigs are gathering, to make the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rod, or the raſour whetting, to ſhave with the keener edge. <hi>Who ever reſiſted the Lord, and proſpered? Shalt thou reigne, becauſe thou dwelleſt in Cedar? Doth not the Lord remember thee, and came it not into his minde? Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Can a ſnare be taken from the earth, and nothing be caught? Is not deſtruction to the ungodly, and a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity? Who can dwell with the devouring fires? Is there any hiding place from the Lords fury? No: though thou ſhouldſt dig into hell, thence would he take thee; though thou ſhouldeſt climbe up into heaven, thence would he fetch thee down; though thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt hide thy ſelfe in the top of Carmell, he would ſearch thee out there; though thou ſhouldeſt lye in the bottom of the Sea, yet there would he command the Serpent to bite thee.</hi> God may ſend the flood, when thou art in the midſt of thy quaffings and dalliances; fire may come down from heaven, when the Sun is ſhining brightly in thy ſtreets; a great cry may be heard in the midſt of the City at midnight, when thou art ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting neither the ſlaughter of the firſt, or firſt-born; the avenger of blood may purſue thee, and pluck thee out of the Cities of refuge; yea, God may ſlay thee, whilſt thou art laying hold on the hornes of the Altar. Hath not God deſtroyed as mighty a people as you? Yes: the Amorites were potent, yet, when their ſins were full, they were emptied out of their Nation. <hi>Rabbah</hi> was a ſtrong City, <hi>the City of waters,</hi> yet it was taken, and the Citiſens put under <hi>ſawes, and harrowes, and axes of iron, 2</hi> Sam. <hi>12.31.</hi> Hath not God ruined as religious places as yours? Yes: <hi>Go ye now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſſe of my people Iſrael.</hi> Jer. <hi>7.12.</hi> Yea, go ye to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> how was that fortreſſe of the earth demoliſhed? yea, that City of oblations made a ſacrifice to the juſtice of a provoked God; yea, left ſuch a relick of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that a book of <hi>Lamentations</hi> was written, to bewail the rufull deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Oh therefore, be not confident, neither upon your proweſſe, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for it is neither your formidable Chivaldry, nor formall Religion which will priviledge you, or protect you; but it is your Repentance which muſt ſhield you, and ſhelter you. See then what muſt ſave you, and what is your one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſervative. There are a great company amongſt you, famed for parts, and magnified for piety; to you I write, you I ſummon, intreating you, by all the worth that your names are embelliſhed with; &amp; adjuring you, by all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox truth, which ye ſeem to have reſerved, out of the defection, and declenſion of the times, that ye would firſt go a Circuit through your own conſciences, and then that ye would walk the ſtreets, and go from the one end of the City to
<pb facs="tcp:96669:9"/>the other, and obſerve the face and face of the City; that ye would take notice of the maladies and ulcers of the City, and conſider what prognoſticating ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes there are of an emigration, and exanimation. Oh feel the weak pulſe of the City, touch her cold lips, and behold her griſly cheeks. Look upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dangers and dyſasters, apprehend what a Flag of defiance is hung out upon earth, and what a ſword is bathed in heaven. Can ſuch ſins, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſafety, ſuch impenitency and the Cities impunity, long ſtand together? Fear ye not ſome plague? ſome generall maſſacre? ſome coal, blown with the breath of the Almighty, that may ſparkle, and kindle, and burn you to ſuch cinders, that not a wall or pillar may be left, to teſtifie the remembrance of a City? <hi>They whoſe judgment was not to drink of the cup, have aſſuredly drunk it off; and ſhalt thou altogether go unpuniſhed?</hi> Jer. <hi>49.12.</hi> May not the viall of red wine be reſerved for the lips of this City? Is here more ſin, and ſhall there be leſſe juſtice? Hath this City been often at her wits end, and may not her braines at laſt be craſed, with an inevitable, and an inextricable judgment? Vengeance deſerred is not recalled; a forbearing-God, may double his diſmaying and confounding ſtroakes. Oh therefore, mark the bad <hi>Craſis,</hi> and the ſad <hi>Criſis</hi> of the City. Help at an exigent; repent, when there is nothing but repentance leſt for an antidote. Repent truly, leſt your repentance prove a ſcandall and a curſe; repent throughly, leſt one unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſin, fruſtrate the vertue of an humiliation; repent timely, leſt not knowing the time of your viſitation, the bleſſings ye wiſh for be hid from your eyes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Repent for your ſelves. For, as the pure minds had need to be warned, ſo the pure conſciences have need to be clenſed. The beſt of you, I fear, have not paſt through the puddle, without ſome filth ſticking upon your skins. Ye have not lived in ſuch an age of Epidemicall diſeaſes, but ye have catched ſome contagion: Therefore ſearch out your own ſpots, and leave not a stain, to be an eye-fore to heaven. Weep out all your contaminations, pray away all your pollutions, purge away all your defilements. Have an hour in the day, a day in the year, for ſtrict and ſolemn repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Repent, to teach others repentance: <hi>When thou art converted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thy brethren.</hi> When ye are quickened your ſelves with <hi>Repentance unto life,</hi> propagate it (if it be poſſible) unto midtitudes, that it may be ſaid, <hi>Behold, here am I, and my children.</hi> Let your believing God, beget faith in others; your ſtanding up from your ſeats, excite others to riſe; your empty bowells, provoke others to faſt; your ſtript backs, cloath others in ſackcloth; your ſquallid demeanours, ſeat others upon the aſh-heap; your making your beaſts partners in the pacifying act, raiſe up a ſtrange penance in the ſtreets; your moiſt eyes, ſet others on weeping; your confeſſing lips, ſtir thoſe tongues in mens heads, which have been ſilent theſe many years; your making repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for errours, cauſe others to deface the memory of foul facts, with oppoſite vertues; your mighty cries fill the City with ecchoes of devotion; your turning from your evill waies, change the ſteps of others from exorbitances; your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your hands from violence, procure oppreſſion to ake in the joynts of other mens fingers. Do your cloſet work well, and be exact in your street-work. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and make a whole City propenſe to repentance.</p>
            <p>To ſome I might ſay, Have ye not heard of repentance? Do ye not know how to repent? Do ye not underſtand the effects of repentance? Have ye not ſeen
<pb facs="tcp:96669:10"/>the fruits of repentance? can ye not repent? will ye not repent? Where did ye ever yet repent? when will ye at laſt repent? Oh that there were repentance! that ye were as eminent in repentance as <hi>Nineveh?</hi> that in ſtead of your Buildings and Bulwarks, Walles and Halls, Works and Wonders, Statues and State-houſes, Pillars and Pearls, hoords of Proviſion, and heaps of Treaſure in the City, that there were but Repentance; yea, that inſtead of your Scriptures and Scribes, numerous Lectures and curious language, Sanctuaries and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Priviledges and Prayers, Meditations and Myſteries, Revelations and Raptures, and the City, that there were but Repentance; that your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo purified, and your Temples ſo ſanctified, that they might afford you ſuch Profeſſours, which were ſuch Saints, that they might be able to bleſſe a Church, and ſave a City, by Repentance. Some Penitents there are amongſt you, but how many Ninivites? Well, ye that have the higheſt opinions of your ſelves, and in the greateſt repute for Religion; know, that ye are but as the ſounding braſſe, and tinckling cymballs, without repentance.

Oh that ye ſtood upon equall numbers, that ye were but the third, the twentieth, the fiftieth, the hundred part of the City; that there were but a common Hall of you, that ye did but equall the number of the Officers, or Watches in the City; that there were but enough to take the frownes out of God's forehead, the menaces out of Gods cheeks, to retard Gods feet, to binde his hands, to put audience into his ears, compaſſion into his eyes, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation into his breaſt, pardon into his lips; to keep his Trumpeters from the gates of the City, or his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Oh behold, how many things there are to tempt you to ſecurity, to cauteriſe you in ſin, and to ſlupifie you to repentance. And as ever ye would ſeem to have rifled your own hearts, to have diſſected your own conſciences, to have ſent the Intelligencer into the City, to have heard the cries of your abhominations at Gods judgment-ſeat, to have ſeen the Armies which are raiſed in heaven, to aſſault you: Oh think upon the City with diſmaied hearts, look down upon the City with weeping eyes, turn aſide to bemoan apparent perlils, and fall upon your knees, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate deſerved vengeance.

Do ye thus repent, and ye are as ſafe as <hi>Nineveh;</hi> God will be your Pleader, and againſt all your Adverſaries (were it <hi>Jonah</hi> himſelfe) multiply reaſons for your preſervation: He will draw pitty towards you from the moſt flinty heart, howſoever his own breast ſhall flow with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; ye ſhall be pretious in his eye, he will forget nothing that may be an incentive for ſparing, not the greatneſſe of your City, nor the multitude of your Perſons, nor the plenty of your Cattle: <hi>Should not I ſpare</hi> Nineveh <hi>that great City, wherein are more then ſix ſcore thouſand perſons, which cannot diſcern between the right hand and the left hand, and alſo much cattle.</hi> I have now ſhewn you the right way to ſafety, walk in it, and ye are gone beyond danger; ye are <hi>the City to be ſpared.</hi>

God will have a refutation in open Court.

               <p>Ye righteous <hi>Saints,</hi> though ye be born to the contention of the People, and contradiction of tongues, though ye be <hi>taken up in the lips of talkers,</hi> Ezech. 36.3. and <hi>your names be caſt out as evill.</hi> Luke 6.22. though <hi>the contempt of Families terrifie you.</hi> Job 31.34. and ye be <hi>a Proverb, and by-word amongſt all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> 2 Kings 19.22. though <hi>they shoot out the lip, and shake the head at you.</hi> Pſ. 22.7.

And as all injured, and infamed Chriſtians may ſuch ſweetly at theſe breſts of conſolation, ſo eſpecially they of mine own tribe, and tribulation; how is the Miniſtery the ſcoffe, and the Clergy the taunt of the Age? He is a man of no courage, and zeal, (as the times think) which hath not belched with the mouth againſt us, and left his ſpittle upon our faces. <hi>The Prophet</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is a fool, the ſpirituall man is mad,</hi> being fit neither to ſtand up in the gapps, nor to ſtand above ground; not to break bread, nor eat bread; not to be eyes to the people, nor to enjoy the eyes in his head; not to hold the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven in his hands, nor to have a key to unlock a dore for himſelf; not to be a breſt to the hungry children, nor to have a breſt to nourſe up himſelfe. No, away with theſe carnall Teachers which have ſome art in their brains, but no integrity in their hearts, which can make a noiſe with their humane learning, but they have not the gift of application, and ſoul-ſearching, they can ſpeak nothing to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience; therfore what ſhould we do with ſuch tinckling Cymbals? This Academical pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? Let us Order them out of their livings, drive them by droves out of their Cures, lock up all Pulpit dores againſt them? let them go graze in the Deſerts, or like the City of <hi>Nob,</hi> wallow in their own goare. But, oh dear Brethren, when we are made the Contempts of the Earth, deſpiſed, deſpipht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſputed againſt; when men have abaſed our gifts, ſteined our reputation, conſulted againſt our ſafety, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps conſpired againſt our blood: Yet will this Oratory hold? this Elench take place? may we not wipe off this ſoil? may we not take out theſe ſpots? may not our innocency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare like the morning light? may not our righteouſnes ſhine forth like the noon-tide brightneſſe? Yes, <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children,</hi> our profeſſion, parts, endowments, and graces may be acknowledged. Therefore let us be quiet under this cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, &amp; not diſmaied with this ſtrife of tongues. When <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> the Orator doth argue &amp; aggravate againſt us ye a when <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet perhaps doth bring in his Bill, and urge for ſentence againſt us; yet like the Eaſtern Chriſtians in the midſt of their extremitie, <hi>Let us fly to the juſtice of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Adeamus juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Dei.</note>
And let us not fear to wander when God is our Guide, nor deſpaire of our caſe, when God is our Pleader. <hi>Niniveh</hi> here by <hi>Jonah</hi> is delivered up to vengeance, Why ſhould ſuch a wicked Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96669:17"/>ſtand a day longer? But doth God ſtand ſilent at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſentence? No, he doth ſave herby argument, plead-her out of the flames; he doth not only defend her, but doth ſhew reaſon for her preſervation, free her by a queſtion, <hi>ſhould not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this doth ſhew that as God doth plead, ſo wee ſhould plead; for there is nothing more naturall to man than ſympathy, nor glorious than protection. Oh happy is he which doth mingle tears with mourners, which doth help to fence off diſmal blowes; which dothſearch out the periſhing in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; doth defend them at the Bar; which is the Shield of the diſtreſſed, nay, the Oratour of the afflicted. Oh how doth it grieve me, and ſhame me to ſee <hi>Ruben</hi> pleading for the life of <hi>Joſeph, Jonathan</hi> interceding for <hi>David;</hi> the <hi>wiſe woeman</hi> from the wall interpoſing for the <hi>City Abel;</hi> Yea, many <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> paſſionately ſeeking the preſervation of juſt perſons, and that we rather ſupplant than ſupport, deſtroy than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, plot than plead? We leave innocent men to their chance, or gaze upon their exigents, or haſten on their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, rather then lend them a face, or open a mouth for them. <hi>That which periſheth, let it periſh;</hi> So let theſe periſh in their callings, and their liberties lay in chaines, or lay with broken neeks, rather then we will oppoſe, or interpoſe, make a motion, or uſe a mediation, ſuffer a check, or endure a frown for their redreſſe; we carry all our members about our ſelves, we are not incorporated into our brethren; our pitty doth but reach to our own ſkins, we have not an heart-ſtring ſtirring to others; In ſtead of reſcuing the afflicted, we are like the Edomites, ſtanding in the croſſe-waies to interrupt them; or like <hi>Doeg</hi> animating them which are enraged already do to miſcheif; or like <hi>Saul,</hi> we conſent to the death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi> I read of <hi>Brennus</hi> when he was ſacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> pleaded to him the breach of Articles, that he gave him no other comfortable expreſſion but to eat a naked ſword, &amp; the ſtanders by were ſo far from righting the injuſtice, that they relieved the oppreſſed only with this dolefull cry of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration,

And theſe are the comforts that we uſually reach forth to the deſolate, and diſconſolate. Wee are readier to break their heart, than to bind them up, and to make their dewy eyes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96669:17"/>to guſh, rather than to ſtaunch a teare; howſoever we ſtretch not forth a hand to ſuccour them, or ſtirre not a tongue to plead for them. Oh how many in the day of adverſity are there, that are fitter for an Invective, then an Apology, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation, and increpation, then for interpellation? What, can they ſtrain their wits, or engage their friends, hazard their eſtates, venture their credits, or turn pleaders for them? No, like men, they know how to keep themſelves out of danger; like wicked men, they have a feat how to plunge them into further perils; they will rather be Oppoſites than Parties; in ſtead of holding out a Target, they will thruſt with a Speare; in ſtead of building to Tower, they will dig a Pit for their friend, <hi>Job</hi> 6.27. in ſtead of ſtudying out terms for preſervation, they lay in wait as they that ſet ſnares, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.26. Oh where is the juſt mans Guardian? where is the good Angell which doth attend upon the diſtreſſed? No, miſery hath no Champion, innocency no Advocate. <hi>He that is falling, is like the Lamp deſpiſed, in the thought of him that is at eaſe,</hi> Job 12.5. <hi>Behold the teares of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and none comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them,</hi> Eccle. 4.1. When the foot of pride hath trampled with tyrannie the needy turned aſide from judgement, and the wine of the condemned drunk in the houſe of God; Who hath there bin to eye their ſorrows, or to plead for their ſafety? Oh ſtupid commiſeration! oh ſpeechleſſe vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Is this your zeal of juſtice to the oppreſſed? is this to be tutelar <hi>Numens</hi> to the afflicted? How ill doe ſuch deſerve a protecting God? or a juſtifying Redeemer? Who ſhall ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your ſorrows? or plead for you at Gods Throne? Oh therefore help the arme that hath no ſtrength, declare your ſelves eyes to the blind, feet to the lame; open your mouths in the caſe of the dumb, be as thoſe which comfort the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. God hath taught you this Oratory, enjoyned you by preſident to take upon you this pleaders office. For when <hi>Jonah</hi> had impleaded <hi>Nineveh,</hi> God doth demur upon the point, or bring in his Rejoinder; what <hi>Jonah</hi> doth ſay, God doth gain-ſay; though <hi>Jonah</hi> hath nothing but deſtruction in his lips, yet the ſound of Gods voyce is nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; he doth for the preſervation of the City perorate and interrogate, <hi>Should not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſerves to ſhew that juſt things are not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted to: for is God enforced thus to reaſon, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, controvert, and plead, then are we quick of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? prone to yeeld to meet propoſitions? ready to incline to what is intimated and repreſented? No, the contrary will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in two particulars. Firſt, That the diſtemper of ſinne is not eaſily cured.

Beware of this root of bitterneſs growing, of this Gangrene ſpreading; there had need be ſome Earth-quake, or cleaving Rockes in ſunder, to make ſuch acknowledge the truth of Chriſt, which have once with more then Jewiſh rage crucified his faith. Here are many ſtrange opinions amongſt us, men have left the living Spring, and ſipped at the broken Ciſterns; they have caſt away the tryed Gold, and filled their purſes with nothing but Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they have forſaken the chaſte Spouſe, and gone to bed with Concubines; they are full of nothing but fictitious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and commentitious; every Quack ſalver can here ſell his Balſomes, and every Merchant of conceptions hath vent for his ſophiſticated Wares.

Oh if wee would rightly underſtand God, we muſt conſult with them which <hi>have underſtanding in the Viſions of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.5. <hi>which feed in the ſtrength of the Lord.

But God forbid, that the defiling ſinner ſhould be ſo full of noiſe: no, <hi>true repentance</hi> doth not know how to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> or howſoever is ſparing of ſpeech. It is an Adage, That <hi>ſilence doth adorne a woman,</hi> much more a Convert; for where ſhould there be found more modeſty, than in an humble ſoule; find we it not in ſcripture? Yes, <hi>Ephraim</hi> doth ſtrike upon his thigh, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to uſe Oratory to excuſe himſelfe: <hi>Job</hi> doth abhor himſelfe in duſt and aſhes, rather than he doth turne Proctor for his ſins; <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is full of teares, but not of words; the Publican doth abound in knocks, but not in ſpeeches. And aſſure your ſelves, that dumb geſtures are fitter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants, then high phraſed bablings, Phariſaicall boaſtings and ſtridulencies. Oh then that we cannot make the criminal man to hold his tongue, that we cannot ſilence the talking ſinner; that though his bell be riven, yet his clapper is not taken out; that though the ſtatute of Bankrupt be ſued out againſt him, yet he is walking the ſtreets, and hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for his reputation. Do we not ſee that open drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, known oppreſſors, publique quarrellers, miſchievous diſturbers of Church and State, are riſe of their tongues? Oh where ſhall we finde inarticulate guilt? what crime is there that is not anſwering, and Rhetoriſing? yes, full of replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and retortion. But is this to be <hi>Jonah?</hi> No, they may ſin with him, but not ſubmit with him? he is refelled, and he hath inſtantly done with anger, and argument? as full of words as he was before, yet being pleaded out guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth not whiſper after Gods interrogatory, not ſo much as ſay, may it be? ſhall it be? can it be? it muſt not be; no, he doth end like a man both convinced, and ſilenced with Gods <hi>ſhould not?</hi>

Let man ſeem to enjoy never ſo much outward greatneſſe, yet mans life is but a <hi>Comedy, whoſe laſt act is death. Solon,</hi> that by the Oracle was prononnced to be the wiſeſt man of his age, ſaid, that <hi>man was but rottenneſſe in birth, a beaſt in his life, and worms-meat in death.</hi> Man art thou not thus? canſt thou not apprehend it? wilt thou not believe it? then let me a little further decipher thee, ſkin thee, and unſkin thee. At thy firſt conception oh that thou couldſt ſee thy ſelf! Thou art but a drop of baſeneſſe, a ſpermatick ſtein, thou art gendring many months to get fleſh, and ſkin upon thy bones, thou ſuckeſt unclean blood, and doſt wſim in a loathſome puddle, thou putteſt out thy head like a beetle out of a dunghill, thou art groaned forth with the half-ſlaughter of thy Mother, thou art plucked out of the womb, and doſt lye in the eyes of all like an hideous fright, there is not an hair of thy head, not a tooth in thy mouth, thou lookeſt like raw fleſh, yea, like a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96669:23"/>prodigious clodder, this is thy entrance; and when thou art rinſed and perfumed, thy navell cut, thy skull ſeamed; and by the Midwifes art, made fit to receive the Babes kiſſe, thou doſt hang upon the breſt, or art fed with ſpoon-meat, thou art rocked in a Cradle, wrapped in ſwadling-clothes, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and waited upon, carried in the arme, led by the hand, learned to go, taught to ſpeak, before thou canſt give one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible expreſſion of a reaſonable creature; And afterwards when by much nurture, and education thou haſt gotten ſome rudiments into thee, whereby thou mightſt declare thy ſelfe man, what manner of man doſt thou witneſſe thy ſelf to be? even at thy ripe age, what are thy geſts, and guiſes, and garbs, and modes: Thou riſeſt in the morning out of thy bed, where thou haſt lain ſo many hours forgotten of thy ſelf, thou clotheſt thy ſelf like one aſhamed to be ſeen without his Veſt, thou calleſt the water to waſh off thy nights filth, thou pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy naſty ears, thou purgeſt thy fowl noſtrils, thou clenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy polluted teeth, and by degrees when thou art compt, and terſe, ſpunged, and powdred, every hair ſet right, and every abiliment put on, what is thy daies work? how doſt thou ſpend pretious time?</p>
               <p>If thou beeſt for profit, thy ranges are known; after thou haſt called up thy ſervants to hunt for gain at home, thou thy ſelf as one in full queſt for lucre abroad, art viſiting other mens Storehouſes, ſearching their Warehouſes, ranſacking their Cellers; Thou goeſt to the Cuſtomhouſe to try what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, and importing there hath been, thou repaireſt to the Exchange to examine what Merchant thou canſt meet with, with whom thou maiſt truck in Minivers, and Tiſſues, Musks, and Civets, the teeth of Elephants, the bones of Whales, the ſtones of Bezars, the claws of Crabs, the Oyles of Swallows, the skins of Vipers, yea, be it but in black Coal, black Pitch, white Chalk, or white Sope, ruſty Iron, or abominable Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it will ſerve the turn; or if thy merchandiſing fail there, thou turneſt thy trading another way, to ſeek about for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, or a Patent, or perhaps to pry out ſome decayed Heir, or foundred Gallant, that thy Ferret might be ſent forth into that borrough, or thy Setting-dog let looſe to drive that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, to hook in ſome Morgage, or to prey upon ſome forfeiture; and if all theſe devices will not take place, then thou ſtirreſt thy leggs to goſuck Venome from a Petty-fogger, or Magick from ſome Conjurer. And thus doth the drudge of the world ſpend his day.</p>
               <p>If thou beeſt for bravery, I cannot follow thee by the track, nor find out thy various Motions. The Gallant is counted a wild creature; no wild Colt, wild Oſtrich, wild Cat of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96669:23"/>Mountain, comparable to him, he is indeed the Baffoon, and Baboon of the times; his mind is wholly ſet upon cuts and ſlaſhes, knots and roſes, patchings and pinkings, jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, taggings, borderings, brimmings, half-ſhirts, half-arms, yawning breſts, gaping knees, Arithmeticall middles, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall ſides, Mathematicall waſts, Muſicall heels, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall toes. I wonder he is not for the Indians branded skin, and ringed ſnowt. His phantaſtick dotages are ſo many, that he hath a Free-School, bookiſh about inventions for him; nay, an Academy of wits, ſtudying deeply to deviſe faſhions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humour: Know ye not the multitude of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Artiſts, Graduates that are ſubliming their notions to pleaſe this one Light-head? Then hear them by their names, Perfumers, Complexioners, Feather-makers, Stitchers, Snippers, Drawers, yea who not? yet amongſt theſe doth the Nitid Spark ſpend out this time: this is the Gallants day.</p>
               <p>If thou beeſt for dainties, how art thou then for ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and pleniſhed Flagons? thou art but a Pantry-worm, and a Paſtry-fly. Thou art all for inlandiſh meat, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh Sawces, thou art the Dapifer to thy Palate, or the Cupbearer to thy Appetite, the creature of the ſwallow, or the ſlave of the weſand. The Land hath ſcarſ fleſh, the ſeafiſh, or the Air fowl curious enough for thy licorous throat, by thy good will thou wouldſt eat nothing but Kids and Fawns, Carps, and Mullets, Snipes and Quailes; and drink nothing but Frontiniack, white Muskadines, Leathick-wine, and Vine <hi>de pary.</hi> Thy Olies and Hogoes, Creepers and Peepers, Italian Cippets and French broaths, do ſhew what a bondman to the paunch thou art; even the Idolatour of the Banquetting-houſe. <hi>Thy belly is thy God.</hi> Thus doth the Glutton waſt out his Pilgrimage: this is the <hi>

               <p>If thou beeſt for luſt, what an Itinerant art thou? canſt thou mark thy Foot-prints whither thy leggs, and thy eyes carry thee? thou ſhouldſt be looking upon her that was once <hi>the deſire of thine eyes,</hi> and embracing her that was <hi>given into thy boſome,</hi> and paying wedlock-rights to her, that was <hi>the wife of thy covenant;</hi> but thou haſt plucked out that eye that thou didſt ſix upon the face of thy firſt <hi>Love,</hi> thou haſt pulled back the hand which thou didſt give in marriage, and cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bond that thou didſt ſeal with ſolemnity upon thy Nuptiall day, and thou art no longer for a chaſt wife, but for ſtrange fleſh, even like a fed horſe neighing after a new Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: Thou haſt forſaken thine own threſhold, and art lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wait as thy neighbours dore; thou haſt left the bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and art for a Couch of dalliance: thy wives breath is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96669:24"/>diſtaſtfull, her face diſpleaſing, and her company odious, and thou art now for amiable Paragons, for Nymphs of beauty; theſe are thoſe whom thou didſt court, and complement, hunt for, and haunt their ſociety; to which thou doſt ſtretch out thy chaunting toung, and graſping arms; to which thou doſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thy ſwarty heart, and blacker Soul. When thy wife can ſcarſe have fragments, theſe ſhall have banquets; when thy wife can ſcarce have fair language, theſe ſhall have Dorian muſick; when thy wife can ſcarſe have ſeemly rayment, theſe ſhall have vails, and rails, cutworks, and networks, blew ſilk, and Purple, Jaſpers, and Saphires; when the wife muſt drudg at home, theſe ſhall dance abroad; when the wife muſt walk on foot, theſe ſhall be coached. The Bride is caſt off, and the Bedfellow embraced, the Spouſe rejected, and the Curtiſan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. Howſoever the wife is tendered, and reſpected, die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and robed, ſure I am, theſe are fed, and clad, men will run into Debtbooks, lay in Jailes, and oftentimes hang on gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets for theſe. And thus doth the voluptuous man meaſure out his time, trickle out his hours; this is the Senſuall mans day.</p>
               <p>Thus man thou art skinned, and when thou art unskinned, what manner of wight art thou? the prodigie of the world, the horrour of the ſenſes, fit for nothing but to be hurled upon the dunghill of nature, or to be hid in the vault of lothſomneſſe; within four daies thou wilt ſtink above-ground, within four months thou wilt rot under-ground, thy Heirs do challenge thy Coffers, the worms thy Carkaſſe. <hi>VVhoſe ſhall all theſe things be? VVhoſe ſhalt thou be?</hi> Within a ſhort time there will be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſeen of thee, as of a Banquet eaten up to the bones, as of a Veſſell drawn out to the dregs, as of a Caſtle raſed to the laſt ſtone, or a City burnt down to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Oh man then, thou miſt of fancy, thou bubble of pride, why art thou enamoured upon thy ſelf? No, if thou couldſt take the right glaſſe to behold thy phyſnomy, thou wouldſt abhor thine own face. Beware therefore how thou doſt ſet too high a price upon thy ſelf, no, leave thy ſelf magnifying humours, for when thou haſt reduced thy ſelf into thy true materialls, either living, or dying, <hi>Who art thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, thou art injured in thrights, much is ſuppreſſed that might make thee eyed with honour? What is that? that thou art the Image of God, and a partaker of the divine nature. It is true, grace is a luſtre, and ſanctification, a Splendour; But bring all theſe perfections together, yet if thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wert as chaſt as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as meek as <hi>Moſes,</hi> as juſt as <hi>Samuel,</hi> as righteous as <hi>Job,</hi> as zealous as <hi>Elias,</hi> as full of divine raptures, and extaſies as <hi>Enoch;</hi> yet whoſe are all theſe qualifications,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96669:24"/>and endowments? alas they are none of thine, they are not the gifts of nature, but the gifts of the ſpirit, therefore what haſt thou to doe to glory in anothers largeſſes? thou maiſt have the comfort in them, but God muſt have the praiſe of them. Beſides, if thou couldſt number thy ſinnes with thy ſervices, thy wants with thy gifts, thy errors with thy graces, thou wouldeſt think thy ſelfe but a puſill Saint. <hi>Jobs</hi> clothes did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file him, and we have ſilthineſſe under all our skirts. <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt be extream to marke what is done amiſs, who is able to ſtand?</hi> One treſpaſs takes away the honour of much obedience; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, multitude of guilts doe obſcure the brighteſt Saint. Therefore ſeeing thou are peccant under a ſtate of grace, yea conſidering thy dayly and infinite failings, let not the pureſt creature face heaven as a worthy; for in reſpect of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and election, if thou doſt lay to heart how much of corrupt nature doth remaine in thee unmortified, and feel the running ſoare of concupiſence breaking out continually with putrified matter, why ſhouldſt thou be arrogant of thy virtues? or make ſanctification an oſtentation? No, thy blemiſh is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, therefore as holy as thou art; yet, <hi>Who art thou?</hi>

God is ſo great, that he wants a known Cauſe by which he ſhould be demonſtrated, and a Genus by which he ſhould be defined: he is ſo great, that he hath heaven for his Court, and Angels for his miniſtring ſpirits, which is one, and yet three; one in eſſence, three in exiſtency; in no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96669:25"/>place, and yet every where, to whom all men are as Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the vaſt Ocean as the drop of a Bucket, who can ſee in the dark, and ſearch hearts; which every year doth ſuſtein whole nature, and every day doth feed a whole world, which doth preſerve Saints in Dungeons, &amp; confound Tyrants in their Thrones; which doth ſhake the Univerſe with earthquakes, and amaze the ſtouteſt with Thunder; which is tyed to no Law, and yet is pure juſtice; which hath no hand, &amp; yet can do all things, which can nouriſh men without bread, and heal men without phyſick; which can take away the ſpirits from the living, and raiſe the dead; which is an univerſall ſurveyor, and will be an univerſal Judge; which can puniſh with unquenchable fire, and raviſh with unſpeakable joy, whom Heathens confeſſe, Chriſtians believe, and Angels adore; whoſe praiſes not a Quire of Seraphims can chaunt forth, whoſe perfections none but a Trinity it ſelfe can deſcribe.

The report of other things is come to our ears, we have diſcovered them to the full, we deſire to heare no more of them: but when ſhall we have a full relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God? or our ears be filled with his report? are we pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to ſo much, that we deſire no more? No, <hi>Theſe are part of his wayes, but what a little portion is there heard of him?</hi> Job 26.14. We can ſift, and ſcrew out other things, but meet we not here with that which is inſcrutable? Canſt thou by ſearching finde out God? canſt thou find out the Almighty to his perfection? <hi>Job</hi> 11.7. yet as ſupereminent as God is, what peerleſſe eſteem is there of him? doe we ſeat him in the firſt place? do we make him a ſuperiour? no, we profeſſe him, but doe not prize him; we ſubſcribe to him, but doe not aſcribe to him; we diſcourſe of him, but doe not deifie him. God hath the leaſt part of the day ſpent upon him, there is the leaſt ſpeech heard of him, our eyes look ſeldomeſt towards heaven, our hearts are leaſt intent upon God. Who would not think, but that we had loſt our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that our Temples were all razed, that we had denyed our Baptiſm, forgotten every Article of our Beliefe? neither our wayes, worſhip, wits, or wills, doe declare a God. In this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-age have we learned a God? In this Lecture-ſolſtice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the light of a Saviour doth there ſo much ſhine amongſt us, as the light of a Superiour? Superiours doe carry great authority with them, but what ſoveraignty hath God? their commands are ruling, but are Gods lawes binding? we live as we liſt for all this God, and act at pleaſure for all this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; we even mock at this God, and brave upon this Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. Sure I am, his manifeſt precepts are neglected, &amp; his known lawes violated in deſpight of his jurisdiction, and maugre his authority; as if he were not able to preſcribe or judge. Doe we, or dare we carry our ſelves thus to other Superiours? doe we ſet up them with no more honour, or give to them no more obedience? Yes, we yield to this bright Phoebus,

O how obſequious and ſervile were they to mans injunctions? their knees did bend, their heads were uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they had Sycophants tongues, and Paraſites cheeks, they did ſhut up their lips, and opened their purſes, did bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens like Aſſes, and were led up and down with rings in their noſtrils like Bears, they did venture their carkaſſes, and jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard their conſciences to ſuch an one, to expreſs duty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyre. But hath God this impery over us? is he ſuch a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? is his reverence like to this feare? his worſhip like to this proſtration? his obedience like to this obſequiouſneſſe? no, the great God of heaven hath not ſo much ſubmiſſion or ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a petty Commander, or an under-Officer. For he doth charge, and enjoyne, ſend forth his ſevere Edicts, and <hi>fiery lawes, Deut.</hi> 33.2. He doth write out commandements with his own finger, and make the viſions plain upon Tables, threaten plagues, denounce judgements, even no leſſe then the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, the cloſe priſon, the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, and what doth he get by it? People doe withdraw the ſhoulder, turn the back, clap with their hands, kick with the heel, behave them ſelves proudly, make the neckiron, and the browbraſs, ſee no more than if they lived in Egyptian darkneſſe, heare no more than if they were in a ſpirit of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, obey no more than if they were given up to a reprobate ſenſe: Oh heare Gods ſad complaints, <hi>How long ſhall I ſuffer?</hi> Mar. 9.19. <hi>I have ſent my Prophets early, and late,</hi> Jer. 7.13. <hi>I looked for grapes, but found none,</hi> Iſai. 5.4. <hi>I am broken with your whoriſh heart,</hi> Ezek. 6.9. <hi>I am preſſed under you as a Cart is preſſed with ſheaves,</hi> Amos 2 13. <hi>I am weary with repenting,</hi> Jer. 15.6.

Thou thinkeſt thou canſt lay on heavy ſtrokes, and ſpeak formidably; but ſtretch out thine arme as farre as thou canſt, and roare as loud as thou art able, yet <hi>haſt thou an arme like God? and canſt thou thunder with thy voyce like him? Job</hi> 40.9.

Oh then let man be no longer the God, and God brought under man; but let man be caſt out, and God ſet up; know his power, conſider his authority, apply thy ſelfe to his will, conform thy ſelfe to his lawes, feare the leaſt guilt before ſuch a confounding Judge.

afflictions may happen, and yet man never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit the more miſerable; for cannot righteous men ſuffer, and yet be happy? Yes, we have often ſeen the elect of God live religiouſly, and yet indure bitter things. <hi>Oh God we did unjuſtly blame thee? that thou didſt bind, and out gracious people.</hi> Therefore we ſhould repine no more at Gods changing of our conditions, than at the changing of the weather; nor at ſome humbling us in our pilgrimage, than at the catching of a fall in our journey; nor at the cutting ſhort of our means, than at the clipping of our over grown locks. God is our Superiour, and we muſt ſubmit all to his pleaſure. But how hard a thing is it for God to keep us quiet? no, we came with a cry into the world, and we are froward Creatures all the dayes of our life: the wiſeſt men have been ſubject to theſe diſtempers, the moſt vertuous men have been prone to this impatience. This was the ſinne of the Iſraelites: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord ſmitten us this day before the Philiſtines?</hi> 1 Sam. 4.3, and of <hi>Job, Wherefore haſt thou brought me out of the womb? Oh that I had periſhed, and no eye had ſeen me,</hi> Job 10.18. and of <hi>David, Why haſt thou forgotten me? why go I mourning when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my oppreſſeth me?</hi> Pſal. 42.9. And are not we ſuch Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Mutineers? Yes, not an accident can fall out, but we are ready to be diſturbed at it; not an action can paſſe from Gods fingers, but we are forward to queſtion both his wiſdome and juſtice. Neither plenty nor ſcarcity, peace nor war, rain nor drought, heat nor cold, the freedom of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, nor the reſtraint of them can pleaſe us. But why do we thus lift up our tongues againſt God? or ſet our mouthes againſt heaven? Is not this to dig up the rottent bones of the Iſraelites? or to ſtigmatiſe our ſelves with their branded ſins? Yes. <hi>Murmur not as ſome of them murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.10. Is it fit for us to ſnarl againſt God, and ſtrive with our Maker? no, if the will of an earthly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour muſt be yeelded to, much more of the heavenly; for <hi>hadſt thou,</hi> and <hi>ſhould not I?</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, this ſerves to teach us all humility, for if God be a Superiour ſhould not this abaſe us? can we be haughty, and inſolent, when our Better is in our eye?

It is enough to make us humble, that we are but Inferiours, for it there not one that hath preheminence over us? Yes, God is our Superiour. How then can we be great in our own eyes, when God doth excell us by many degrees? No, our qualifications are not to be thought of in reſpect of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; for lay Face to Face, Place to Place, Power to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Honour to Honour, Graces to Graces, and what is the Black-more to the Bright God?

He whoſe worth doth carry an adequate commenſuration with his calling, is beſt skilled in Geometry, I might ſay he hath the beſt inſight into Divinity; for doe not all gracious perſons obſerve this levell? and make greatneſſe the ſquare of goodneſſe? Yes, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was left officer in his Maſters abſence, he would not meddle but with that which was under his diſpoſing; he had the command of all <hi>Potiphars</hi> goods, but his Miſtreſs he thought was none of thoſe utenſils a Steward ought to deale with: therefore when ſhe tempted him to lie with her, he would be her ſervant, but not her bed-fellow; he would loſe his coat, rather than be drawn to a couch of dalliance; he readeth over the Bill of his charge to her, and telleth her, that ſhe is left out of the commodities which he was to lay hand on. <hi>Behold my Master knoweth not what he hath in the houſe with me, but hath committed all that he hath to my hand. There is none greater in his houſe than I, neither hath he kept any thing from me but thee, becauſe thou art his wife. How then ſhall I commit this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt my God?</hi> Gen. 39.7, 8, 9. verſ. <hi>Thus</hi> Michaeas <hi>when he was ſent for to reſolve</hi> whether <hi>Achab</hi> ſhould go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> or not, though four hundred Prophets had declared before for the journey, and ſaid, it ſhould be proſperous; and the King himſelfe had expreſſed his high diſ-affection againſt him; for <hi>he doth not propheſie good, but evill unto me:</hi> and a prepared meſſenger had uſed all manner of inſinuating terms to put the Court-tone into his mouth; for <hi>Behold now the words of the Prophets declare good unto the King with one accord; let thy words therefore be like one of them, and ſpeak thou good.</hi> Yet it is neither the Kings diſpleaſure, nor the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers flattery, can make him vary, or put a plyable, compliable Tongue into his mouth; no, I am a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and muſt keep my calling unſpotted; therefore <hi>whatſoever the Lord ſaith, that will I ſpeake,</hi> 1 King. 22.14. Thus <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he was intreated to a conference by <hi>Tobiah, Sanballat, Geſhen,</hi> the powerfull men of the Country, and a meſſenger with an open Letter in his hand, had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with rebellion, telling him that he aſpired, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Crown: for <hi>thou wouldeſt be King, and accuſed him for ſeducing the prieſthood, as if he had gotten Mercenary Chaplains to preach up his Title, and given him the lie; for it is not done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe words that thou ſayeſt but thou feigneſt them out of thine owne heart;</hi> and as the laſt deſigne they had treated with his own party, even corrupted the ſeeming Saints of the age; yea hired the Prophets to take him off, and terrifie him; for <hi>Noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> with the reſt of the holy league and combination had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96669:32"/>put him in feare; and <hi>Delaiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Mehetabeel,</hi> in ſhew devotion had ſhut up himſelfe in the Temple, and there upon his knees, had ſought God, that by revelation he might ſtate the buſineſſe; He, even he diſſwaded him to leave the wall, and to take Sanctuary; for ſaith he, <hi>Let us come together into the houſe of God, and ſhut the doores of the Temple, for they will come to ſlay thee, yea in the night will they come to kill thee;</hi> yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe frights and charmes, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; yea the propheticall lure cannot take him, for he thinketh that theſe Altar-wights, and Viſion-men, are not too much to be truſted, ſnares and gins he thought might be laid in the Temple it ſelfe. Therefore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth keep his ground, and would not be ſtrook blind by the Seers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor drawn away from his charge by a revelation-ſtring. It is the wall that I have undertaken the defence of, ſaith he, and if I depart from it, I betray the cauſe: if I doe but turn my face, all will deſert the buſineſſe; farewell Wall and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Where are their emblaſoned armes? where are the creſts of their eſcutcheons? they have forfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their arms, they have ſteined their blood; every Hind, or Rurall Blebeian would have diſdeigned to be ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſted; what regard have they expreſſed to fame, or family, name or Nation, Church or God? No, they have had vaſt Eſtates, and even for the rentall ſake they have looked to preſerve their ſkins, and not their credets; their heaps, and not their honours. Oh what a fetter is the golden chain? what an intoxicating bowl is the cup, that doth run over with earthly abundance? their eſteem is ſtarved to get the bread of increaſe, and they have left a lean conſcience to make ſure the fat portion; let all honour go, when the main dormant of the houſe doth crack, and the roof of greatneſſe doth begin to be untiled; the fane doth turn according as the wind of ſecurity doth blow, and the ſhip doth ſail according as the rudder of ſelf preſervation doth ſteer.

he had forgiven them an horrid outrage committed againſt him, they took it ſo kindly, that beſides other rich gifts they honoured him with, they ſent him the Candleſtick of <hi>Salomon.</hi> But where are our Songs, and Crowns, and golden Candleſticks as thankfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of Gods mercy? No, we are often ſpared, but purſe up all favours like legacies, which are never thought on, after the money is told out; or wee turn them off like Phyſitians, which are no longer minded, then the cure is working; if we have ſaluted freedom, farvvell God, and mercy. Indeed a ſparing God ought to be pretious to us, Mercy ſhould be the gaze of our eyes, and the trance of our hearts; for the light of Heaven ſhould not be more pleaſing to us, than the light of Gods countenance, not the ſparkling Ruby, then Gods white Stone; not the Apple of the Eye, then Gods pittifull eye; not the nources breſt, then Gods boſom; not the caſting a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of Court, than Gods caſting ſins behind his back; not the pardoning ſignet, than Gods ſetting us as a ſeal upon his heart; nor the forgiving of debts, than the not imputing treſpaſſes; Oh how ſhould we dance about this appeaſing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, bow towards this propitiatory, ſmell with a fragancy the coſtly perfumes which come ſteaming out of this golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer? But alas we ſpunge out the memory of benefits, raze out the characters of preſervation, we eye not our reſcues after they are reached forth unto us; we look not upon our pardon after it be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96669:38"/>once granted. Favour hath ſcarce a Panegyrick, or Mercy an Anniverſary; we conſider not what it is to be freed, we know not what it is to be ſpared. To be ſpared from an Amerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, a Tax, a Sequeſtration, a Meſſenger, a troubleſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, is very operative upon us; ſuch a thing doth lye near to our hearts, there is cap, &amp; knee, the ſeet tripudiate, the cheeks look blith, the teeth chatter at ſuch a reſpect; but to be ſpared by God there is neither reverence, nor worſhip, eccho, nor extaſie: we deſire mercy, but not delight in it; pray for it, but not prize it; weep for it, but live not worthy it. Oh what deſpiſers are we of favours? what a lethargy is there of mercies? how ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do we kiſſe Gods ſparing hand? Is this ſenſe? is this diſcerning? is this gratitude? is this devotion? <hi>Do ye thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord, oh fooliſh people?</hi> Let me pull the vail from the face of this beautifull <hi>Rachel,</hi> and ſhew you what an amiable Creature ſhe is; let me repreſent <hi>Mercy</hi> to you, and cauſe you to look upon her as a Celeſtiall Deity. I do not ſay, it is that which gave you the firſt quickning, inched you in the womb, rocked you in the cradle, ſet you upon your leggs, gave you feature and ſtature, rudiments and reaſon, favour and fame, which bought every cloth to your backs, hath put the keyes of your houſes into your hands, furniſhed your Wardrobes, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your Dining-chambers, opened your ſhops, ſteered home your ſhips, ſtored your Warehouſes, guided Cuſtomers to your threſholds, filled your Coffers whereby ye are able to trade with the greateſt; and purchaſe with the richeſt; which hath brought you from the ſingle to the ſecond ſervices, from the Stall to the Summer-houſe, from the coorſe dreſſe to the Livery, and the golden Chain; that hath been your Agent, your Solicitour, your Spoakſman in the City, Friend at Court, your Steward by day, and your Chamberlain by night; but I paſſe by variety of bleſſings, though ye cannot ſay but all theſe cluſters do hang upon Mercies boughs, &amp; all theſe ſwelling Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do flow out of Mercies vaſt Ocean, there being not a year wherein Mercy doth not beſtow amongſt you Donatives, nor a day wherein Mercy doth not ſcatter amongſt you her lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes. But I tell you (according to my Text) that Mercy is your refuge, and your Shield, your Caſtle, and your Sanctuary, your Sentinell, your Champion, your Pleader, and your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; it doth keep your feet out of the ſnare, your necks out of the yoak, your breſts from the arrow, your heads from the Pole-axe; it is your ye that watches over you in darkneſſe, your arm every morning; it doth preſerve your bodies from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Earth, and ſave your Souls from the torments of Hell; when ye are ready to be puniſhed, it doth pardon; when ye are ready to be ſpoiled, it doth <hi>ſpare.</hi> Oh that Mercy is ſuch a bright Star, and yet that we have neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96669:38"/>the Aſteriſm, nor taken the Altitude of it, that we are ready to commit Idolatry to a preſerving Man, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worſhip at the footſtool of a ſparing God! that Heathens have been aſtoniſhed, Chriſtians have wondred, and Angells admired at the ſight of thoſe protections which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and yet that our reſcues are gone out of our eys, and our deliverances out of our lips; that mercy hath no memory; nor preſervation any obſervation; that the pardoning God is not a magnified God; that he hath for all his favours nothing but ingratitudes. Benefits have no Triumphs, Mercy doth not wear her Crown; the impreſſions of bleſſings are worn out, the Records of ſafety are loſt; Oh that our praiſes were anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our protections! But amongſt multitudes, which have been cleanſed from the Leproſy, there is but one which doth return to give thanks. Oh beloved have ye tender ſkins? can your ſhoulders endure no burthens? do ye love to be kept from the hour of temptation? do ye deſire with the woman in the Revelation to have the two wings of an Eagle to fly from dangers?
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.14.</note>
can ye not endure to be chaſtned with the rod of men, broken with a tempeſt, to be toſſed like a ball in a large Country, to be fanned in the gate of the land, to be ſet as a mark for the arrow, to have your teeth broken with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell ſtones, to drink the water of gall, or to eat the bread of Mourners, to be bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction, to have your heads bowed down with ſufferings, or afflictions wreathed about your necks? Doth the leaſt diſtreſſe drive you into paſſions, make your hearts melt within you, diſcruciate you, exanimate you, cauſe you to tear your own fleſh, make a wayling like the Dragons, and to belch out your ſorrows with a rage, that doth reach up to Heaven? And is Mercy your Guardian, and the Keeper of your heads to prevent all theſe miſeries, and to ſecure you from all theſe hazards, and yet will ye not know her ſoft hand, and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breſt, not honour every joint of her preſerving arme, and magnifie every feather of her ſafegarding wings? have ye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, &amp; Hymns, Charmings, and chauntings and none for Mercy? what not a diſtich, a ſemibrief for Mercy? Doth Mercy bleſs all the Earth, and is all the Earth dumb? doth that ſpare, and are we ſpeechleſſe? Zeal then, where are thy ſparks?

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96669:39"/>benefits, and as ye love your lives, tender your own blood, let mercy have your life-ſong: Oh how often hath ſhe been unto you a refuge from the ſtorme, a cover from the face of ſpoils? How often hath ſhe fenced off dangers, and hid you in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pavilion? Oh therefore when this glorious Queen doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your ſtreets, let all the Bells in the ſteeple, all the Tongues in the Profeſſors heads, ring a peal to the honour of mercy; let there be praiſes, &amp; paraſangs, Elogies and exultations, ſongs and Selahs, to exalt mercy.

Remember <hi>that the wrath of man doth not accompliſh the righteouſneſſe of God, that he that hateth his brother is a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer;</hi> therefore, <hi>As much as in you lies have peace with all men,</hi> yea, <hi>Above all things put on love, which is the beſt bond of perfection.</hi> Conſider how your Saviour was like a <hi>Sheep upon Earth, which did not open his mouth,</hi> and that in Heaven be ſitteth like a <hi>Lamb in the midſt of the Throne;</hi> As <hi>David</hi> did not regard <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei's</hi> curſings, ſo walk you like deaf men, and blind men in the midſt of this abuſefull, and provoking age. Let <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay, <hi>Let there be no ſtrife betwixt me, and thee, for we are brethren,</hi> and let Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Ye have not hurt me in any thing;</hi> feed not upon diſcontents here, which are to eat <hi>Mannah</hi> in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdom; let not your inſtruments here jar, which are elſewhere to ſtand amongſt the harpers harping upon their harps.</p>
               <p>Be readier to lend a courteſie, than to repay an injury, and to ſhed tears than to ſhed blood; Leave vengeance to God, and for the ſake of Chriſts wounds, feel not too much thine own bruiſes, or cuts. Prepare for the Sacrament by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling thy ſelf to thy brother, and pave the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a charitable demeanour. Forbear deſolations, when thou art able to lay waſt; and let thy Enemy live, when thou haſt his life at thy mercy: for this is not only the ſigne of a noble nature, but it is to be a partaker of the Divine Nature; for when God can ruin, he doth preſerve; when he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate, he doth ſpare, <hi>Should not I Spare?</hi>

               <p>Firſt for the name of a place, <hi>Nineveh.</hi> What? <hi>Nineveh</hi> the proud, and prophane, arrogant, and peccant, whoſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and ſecurity was ſuch, that a Prophet was drawn from far to diſcover their iniquity, and denounce judgments? (For <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſent not only with a meſſage, but a menace, <hi>hee must cry againſt it, becauſe their wickedneſſe was come up before God.</hi> Chap. 1. v. 2. and he muſt cry confuſion to it, and that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too, for <hi>Yet forty daies, and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be overthrown?</hi> Ch. 3. v. 4.) No, this is not the <hi>Nineveh</hi> which God is ſo tender of, and he doth argue ſo with <hi>Jonah</hi> for the preſervation of it: no, if <hi>Ninveveh</hi> had perſiſted in her impiety, God would have been no Pleader for her, neither would he have made the leaſt motion for her ſparing; but it is <hi>Nineveh</hi> the changed, and renewed; for <hi>Nineveh</hi> had been wicked, but ſhe had ſeen her wickedneſſe, ſearched it out, and ſeparated her ſelf from it: and here indeed is the incentive of Divine commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſo ſoon as God ſaw his meſſage entertained, he is no longer an Adverſary, but an Advocate; he doth pitey <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and would pardon it; he doth ſpeak for it, and doth ſpare it: Yea, he doth reaſon with <hi>Jonah,</hi> why <hi>Nineveh</hi> having confeſſed the fact, and put her ſelf upon the mercy of the Court, God ſhould not recall his ſentence, and ſpare the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Judgment. What, ſaith God, ſhall I trample upon the proſtrate? ruine the humbled? then I ſhall ſeem to abhor that, which I do affect, and to puniſh that which I do take pleaſure in; Who will ever bluſh for ſin, if abaſement be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed? or ſhed tears, if the weeping tranſgreſſour be judged? theſe then having found out their ſin, I can no longer purſue it; they were guilty, they are innocent, they were culpable, they are acceptable; ſuch a ſeeking people are to be owned,

               </p>
               <p>And that God did not ſpare <hi>Nineveh</hi> for the bare Walls, but for the repentance within the walls, is the judgement of the moſt learned Expoſitors,

and many more, it is apparent; tha though God doth but onely name <hi>Nineveh,</hi> yet he meant penitent <hi>Nineveh;</hi> yea, for their change, God doth change: and becauſe they did not ſpare repentance, he would have them ſpared for their repentance. <hi>Should not I ſpare Nineveh,</hi> that is, <hi>Nineveh</hi> the repaired and renewed?</p>

Solution I am not well skilled in, (what vertue ſuffrages have for ſouls departed); but I am ſure Abſolution hath a preſent effect and efficacy. <hi>David</hi> doth get ſouls-eaſe with a breath, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of Chriſt's preſence without her pardon in her hand, no ſhe ſought for it by teares: <hi>And he ſaid unto her, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> Luk 7.48. <hi>Zacheus</hi> is not put to expectation, what the iſſue of his humble acknowledgement of Chriſt ſhould be; no he had called him Lord, and he ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find him a Lord, for <hi>This day ſalvation is come to this houſe,</hi> Luk. 19.9. This <hi>Deiopeia</hi> can be the Mother of none but a faire Progeny, none but amiable beauties come out of the wombe of repentance. In <hi>Goſhen</hi> is nothing but light, upon mount <hi>Gariſim</hi> are nothing but bleſſings, out of repentance comes nothing but a ſtate of approbation. I will rather feare that the Rainbow is not an undoubted ſigne to prevent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and the Urim and Thummim not to be a certain Oracle to reſolve doubts, then I will ſuſpect repentance to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Charter for ſpirituall liberties. Oh that thou wert penitent, I would ſhew thee the Serpents ſting falling out of thy ſides, the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit dropping his keyes out of his hand, the Accuſer of the brethren ſtanding ſpeechleſſe in Gods Court, this Jordan waſhing thee cleane, this <hi>Betheſda</hi> healing thee of thy mortall diſeaſe, the Angels of heaven comming forth to ſalute thee, and rejoyce over thee, and the Father ſtretching out his hands to imbrace thee,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96669:43"/>and putting ſhooes upon thy feet, a ring upon thy finger, and the beſt robe upon thy back: Whatſoever Penitent doth ſtand here, I pronounce, that he hath broken the yoak of bondage, he hath leaped out of Hell, and though <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt do purſue after him to catch him, and to new-fetter him, the Devill, and his trained bands of ſins do march after him to captivate him, and to bring him back to his old chains; yet he is out of their reach, he hath left all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies behind him, and none ſhall be able to lay hands on him, if he hath but paſt this red Sea, the Egyptians whom he hath ſeen to day, he ſhall ſee no more hereafter, they all lay pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that brine, drinking their laſt in that deep, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming bowl, either ſwimming dead above water, or lying dead upon the Shore. The penitent, and his ſins are parted, as <hi>Moſes</hi> left the Court, when he took upon him to be a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Zacheus</hi> left his Publicans office, when hee intended to devote himſelf to Chriſt; he hath given them a diſcharge, and quite abdicated them, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaid to his Idols, <hi>quid mihi ultra? What have I to do any more with you?</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. Repentance is the Funerall of ſin, and the birth-day of grace, a man then ſhifts himſelf out of the tatters of naturall corruptions, &amp; doth array himſelf in the bright veſtment of regeneration, as <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> put off his filthy garments, &amp; put on a change of rayment upon his back, and a glorious Mitre upon his head. He is ſo transformed, that not onely all the Earth doth look upon him with delight, but the eye of Heaven is taken with him: he need not be troubled with any of his former guilts, nor fear the charge that his ſins have preferred againſt him, for the Enditement is taken out of Court; he dare preſent himſelfe before the Judge, for he is ſure to be juſtified at the Throne of grace. The <hi>Penitent</hi> man ſhall be pardoned, <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall be ſpared. Repentance is a Vertue; now can there be a Vertue, which ſhould leave a man as a ſpotted creature in Gods eye?

The Penitent hath no ſooner made his addreſſes, but he hath a gratious reception, for, <hi>Let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Eſa. 55.9. <hi>Return oh back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you.</hi> Jer. 3.12. <hi>I have heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>lamenting thus, Thou haſt corrected me, and I was chaſtiſed as an untamed Heifer, convert thou me oh Lord and I ſhall be converted, for thou art the Lord my God.

yet a man repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in particular of ſome grievous ſins which burthen his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and in generall of all ſins that he conceiveth he may have committed, this ſhall procure him a full remiſſion, for one ſin is not forgiven without another. So that it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that pardon of ſin is an inſeparable effect of repentance, for as ſin in thoſe that have the uſe of reaſon cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given without repentance, ſo it cannot but be forgiven by repentance; for repentance hath ever grace annexed to it, and that grace doth confer juſtification; Was it ever heard that a juſtified perſon had yet a new reconciliation to make? No, juſtification is from one contrary to another, that is, from a ſtate of wrath, to a ſtate of favour: to be accounted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and made righteous is the formalliſing act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. What then? ſhall repentance be a project, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly upon event? or an experiment, whoſe iſſue is in the ſucceſſe? or a lottery, where blanks, or prizes may be drawn? ſhall a man abhor himſelf, and not know whether he ſhall be rejected, or accepted? ſhall a man turn to the Lord with all his heart, and have no aſſurance, whether God will ſhew his face, or turn his back upon him?

For what were this but for God to inſult upon the proſtrate? and to ſet his face againſt them that ſeek his face? yes, it were to wring the ſinne-offering out of the ſacrificers hand, and to kill men at the ſides of his own altar. God can try no maſteries with them that ſubmit, nor lay them gaſping for life, which are already halfe dead in ſpirituall anguiſh; for then he ſhould lay his axe to the root of the fruitfull tree, and make a waſte upon the ground, that brings forth hearbs meet for the dreſſer; not make men beare their iniquity, but beare their integrity; not onely not be ſlack to them that hate him, but quick againſt them that deprecate him.

The fooliſh Galathians were for their own falſe Apoſtles, and the ripe-witted Corinthians for their artificiall Teachers; the great Council, the Sanhedrim of the Jewes will not accept of a Meſſiah from the Apoſtles, no, rather whip them for preaching up ſuch an one to them.

For the object of contrition being guilt, and every guilt requiring his proper grief, how eager had that contrition need to be, that is to be exerciſed about all theſe ſins? all the ſorrows of nature are not like to the griefs of a penitent in reſpect of diſplicency; but onely in reſpect of the exteriour anguiſh; nature may exceed in her griefes, but contrition as it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

Oh what light ſkirmiſhes do we uſe? how do we retreat upon the firſt Juſts? we do not hold up our hands till they be weary, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; we do not with wreſtlings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bleſſings as <hi>Jacob</hi> did.

Can we not diſſemble in our Petitions? yes, as well as in our practices; why elſe doth God complaine of mens howling upon their beds, rather than whining out their own errours? <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds,</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. <hi>Their feare towards me is taught by the precepts of men,</hi> Iſai. 29.13. as if there were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State-prayers, then Penitents prayers. <hi>Ye diſſembled in your hearts, when ye ſent me unto the Lord, ſaying, Pray for us unto the Lordour God,</hi> Jer. 42.20. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> made long prayers, but ſhort enough of their own guilts, there was not a word of their own Superſtitions, wicked Traditions, devouring wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes, &amp; teaching children to cheat their own Parents. There is a craft in Prayers, we are the greateſt Impoſtours in our devotions that can be imagined; there is ſome ſpeech of ſinnes in generall, but not of ſinnes in ſpeciall, of ſinnes that our own fancies have fixed a blemiſh upon, but not of the deep ſpotted, the crimſon and ſcarlet ſinnes.

We cannot ſpeak out our proper ſins, nor launce the wound to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, when we are begging balſome from heaven?

No, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Drunkenneſs, Blaſphemy, Hatred, are ſins of an evill name, but Oppreſſion goes for an argument of wit, and ſets forth a perſon onely as a man of the better brain. How ſhall the Merchant live without his Shop-arts? or the great man in the Country Lord it, without cruſhing of Tenants? or the Judge go to his grave as a well fleſhed fatling, without feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberally upon his by-Incomes? For this end the Merchants is for his ſcant meaſure, wicked ballances and bad of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full weights; the Country Lord is for the rough juſtle, thruſting with thigh and ſhoulder, and the Rulers love to ſay with ſhame, <hi>Bring ye.</hi> The Ninevites hands do ake with their violence, but when ſhall this violence ſmart upon our fingers ends? Oh it were a comfortable age, if there were none to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe. What ſweet tongues ſoever we have with <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet our hands are the hands of <hi>Eſau.</hi> God may ſay to us as he did to <hi>Cain, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thy Brothers blood at thy hand,</hi> Gen. 4.11. If God ſhould demand (according to his Law) <hi>hand for hand,</hi> Exod. 21.24. What a diſmembred Nation would there be? <hi>the hand of the avenger,</hi> Numb. 35.25. would be ready to purſue too many. Mens hands are at work, and it is an hard thing to <hi>deliver one out of the hands of him that is too ſtrong for him,</hi> Deut. 25.11. We ſhould lift up our hands as the incenſe, and ſtretch out our hands to the needy, and joyn the right hands of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but we kiſs our hands, and clap with our hands, and ſtrike with our hands; our hands ſhould be full of nothing but devotion, almeſdeeds, and pledges of charity, and they are full of nothing but miſchiefs, ſhrewd turnes, and batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of violence. Woe be to him that comes within the reach of theſe hands, and feel the weight of theſe hands. Moſt men like <hi>Saul,</hi> ſtand with a Spear in the hand, or with the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, they are ready to caſt ſtones with their hands. Whether they will waſh them yea or no I know not, ſure I am, <hi>their hands are defiled with blood;</hi> whether they will cut them off yea or no, I cannot reſolve you, certain I am, they do offend them; there are <hi>the hands of cruell Lords</hi> Iſai. 19.4. <hi>hands that ought to be fled from,</hi> 1 Sam. 27.1. We may fear the hands of many, as much as the clawes of Vultures. Oh Land of boyſterous hands! Oh Nation of brutiſh violence! Theſe beaſts of <hi>Epheſus</hi> will not be unſkinned, theſe fat Bulls of <hi>Baſhan</hi> will never have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96669:86"/>their horns ſawn off. May not God ſay ſtill, <hi>Oh ye deſtroyers of my heritage?</hi> Jer. 50.11. Are not the birds of prey <hi>ſwifter than the Eagles of heaven amongſt us?</hi> Lam. 3.19? Here is much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting for meanes, <hi>every one lyeth in wait for bloud, and hunteth his neighbour with a net,</hi> Mich. 7.3. It is much that many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can take their nights reſts, <hi>for they ſleep upon the cloaths laid to pledge,</hi> Amos 2.8. It is much they can dwell in their houſes, for the ſtones were hewn out of the wrong quarrey, <hi>they build their Houſes by unrighteouſneſſe, and their Chambers by wrong,</hi> Jer. 22.13. They have wedged up vaſt Eſtates, but how were theſe heaps gathered? <hi>Are not the treaſures of iniquity in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the wicked?</hi> Micah. 6.20. Oh that theſe men can walk the ſtreets, the cryes of the oppreſſed are ſo ſhrill againſt them; that they can eat their meat, when they find ſuch ſtrange fleſh in the Cauldron; that they can deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their eſtates, when they know by what an <hi>Ahabs</hi> evidence they hold the Vineyard; that they can make their Wills, when they feel, at their laſt death-prongs, that they are but to give away ill-gotten goods for Legacies! They are dangerous neighbours to live by, for the <hi>wicked doth devour the man more righteous than himſelfe,</hi> Hab. 1.13. They are uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Fathers, for <hi>the Lion doth teare in pieces for his whelps,</hi> Nahum. 2.12. <hi>Go tell Herod the Fox,</hi> Luk. 11.32.

For all the noiſe of our Sermon-bells, and the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven preached amongſt us, here is nothing but ſhaving, and fleecing, pinching and biting, catching and cruſhing, ſupplanting and circumventing, conſuming &amp; confounding, decocting and deſpoyling, ſlaying and flaying, proſecuting and perſecuting, mingling and powdering, glozing and var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, ſophiſticating and adulterating, lengthning out of ſuits, and ſpining out of quarrells, ſiding and ſhouldering, trampling and ſhivering, dreadfull decrees in the Court of Conſcience, and horrid Orders divers times in the beſt Court of Judicature, as if oppreſſion were a ſcience, and tyranny a trade. Oh where ſhall the wronged ſeek for reliefe? where ſhal the innocent find a bar of juſtice? It would perplex a man to think how many writs are filed, how many records are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, how many Bills are preferred, how many judgements and executions are paſſed, how many Regiments there are of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96669:86"/>Serjeants and Bailiffs, how many Brigads of Atturneys and Counſailers in this one little Kingdom. If violence were not predominant, what need there be called in ſo many neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agents to reſtrain it? if the houſe were not ruinous, what need there ſo many Maſter-Workmen be employed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it? Theſe are fangs enough of oppreſſion; but come forth, and I will ſhew thee more abominations. How many are there that ſeek places to ſuck the veins of the people? how many buy Offices to ſhark upon the Common-wealth? how many turn Informers, Promoters, Waiters, Searchers, not to diſcover, but to diſtill, not to puniſh, but to prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on errours. Oh, if I ſhould lead you into the Forreſt it ſelfe, where all the wild beaſts and ravenous Serpents do range, ye would think that this were the Land of Tigers and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.

But oh beloved, let us be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with our ſoules, and reall with our God; at laſt can the times juſtifie us, or the partiality of our friends ſave us? no, repentance is our triall, and God is our judge; we are a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generation, and an ill-affected people till we turn; do ye call home your ears therefore from the falſe Prophets lips, and take your hearts out of the Inchanters hands, which tell you ye are a pure people, and the godly of the earth; oh thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands may periſh by ſuch Pulpits; there is not a ſtronger chain of hell, then the tongue of an inſinuating and infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Teacher, which for morſells of bread, and handfuls of barley, will tranſgreſs; let us account him the true Preacher, which will purifie our inwards, yea the right <hi>Jonah</hi> which wil preach us into <hi>Nineveh.</hi> We know our ſins, let us have <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehs</hi> heart-ſtroaks; our ſins do purſue us, let us have <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehs</hi> protection and preſervation; let us not pretend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on except we repent, let us not repent except we be <hi>Nineveh.</hi> Oh let not our eyes be open, and our hearts aſleep, our ears liſtening, and our conſciences deaf, our tongues pure, and our converſations defiled. If God doth threaten, do ye believ God; if he doth move from his Throne, doe ye ariſe from your Thrones; if he doth put on juſtice like a Cloak, doe ye caſt away your Robes; if he be ready to rend your Garments from your backs, do ye put on ſackcloth; if he he blowing up his coals, and about to <hi>burne againſt Jacob,</hi> doe ye ſit in the aſh-heap; if he be calling in variety of judgements to plague, do ye call in King, Nobles, and Citizens, to pacifie; if he be reſolving upon diſmall things, do ye do memorable things; if he doth frown, do ye weep; if he be ſetting your ſinnes in order before you, do ye confeſſe them; if he be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf for injuries, do ye make reparation; if he be upon the point to confound mightily, do ye cry mightily; if his feet be turning into the viſiting ways, do ye turn every one from his evil wayes; if his hand be laying hold on judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do ye purge your ſelves from the violence of your hands. Let us leave nothing in deſpair, that we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but after <hi>Ninevehs</hi> repentance, we may have <hi>Ninevehs</hi> faith, ſaying, <hi>Who can tell, if God will turn, and repent, and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his fierce wrath that we periſh not?</hi> Chap. 3. v. 9. So long as we are impenitent, all our Stateſmen and Eſtatesmen, Challengers and Champions, Guards and Gunrooms, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Truces, Treaſures and Triumphs, cannot ſecure us, but ſo ſoon as Repentance doth come, our feares do vaniſh,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96669:89"/>our hopes do revive, our confidence doth wax ſtrong, and our ſafety is infallible; Oh therefore that our ſins, and our miſeries may not meet together; let us try how we can break our hearts, and break up the fallow ground, and break off our ſinnes by righteouſneſſe; that God may not ſearch Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem with lights, let us ſearch our ſelves; conſider what hath been done in the quaffing-room, the bed of dalliance, the Banquetting-houſe, the Councell-Chamber, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, the Tribunall, the Parlour, and the Pulpit: let us ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack all back-rooms, ſearch all blind corners, and leave not a ſinne undiſcovered, which conſcience may ake under, and repentance can mortifie. Oh for all the cryes of your ſinnes, and the cryes of the Temples, the ſtings of guilt, and gripes of conſcience, the ſcandall of your enemies, and the ſcourge of heaven, for the pattern at <hi>Bochim,</hi> the precedent at <hi>Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peh,</hi> the example of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> to ſave the land, and ſave your ſoules, <hi>Repent.</hi> Oh Repentance, thou which beganneſt at the firſt fall, which didſt ſave eight perſons at the flood, a little family at the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> a great Nation at the ſlaughter in Egypt: which wert commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Prophets, which wert the firſt cry of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. the firſt voyce that the <hi>Word</hi> himſelf uttered at the unſealing of his commiſſion, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14. which the Apoſtles did proclaim, and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church doth preſcribe, which art able to tranſnature and tranſlate people, to purifie them in life, to pacifie them in death &amp; to juſtifie them at the Throne; which canſt unlock the gates of heaven, put the triumphant palm into the hand, and ſet the Crown of immortal glory upon the head; oh be thou viſible in this Nation, &amp; till thou canſt make us the new Jeruſalem, make us <hi>Nineveh.</hi> Oh beloved, liſten to repentance, begin the work, make it compleat, think it a neceſſary thing to repent, think it not an eaſie thing to repent, make a ſtrict inquiſition, and have an heart-aking diſcuſſion; fall upon your knees, hold up your hands, let not your converſion be too high-browed, nor your repentance too blunt-edged; bluſh and bleed, ſigh and ſob, wring and wayl, ſcrape the walls infected with the leproſie, hate the garment ſpotted by the fleſh, <hi>Mortifie your members which are upon earth, abstain from all appearance of evill, live as if ye converſed with Angels, and did but tread below to clenſe your ſelves before ye put on the white Robe.</hi> Oh come out of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig-pot without any droſs, come out of the Bath without a ſteyn; as your crimes have been exorbitant, ſo let your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be exemplary.

               </p>
               <p>That ye may not forget that which I delivered unto you in the beginning, I will for the preſent joyn both theſe parts together, and ſhew you (as I did at firſt) that God in theſe words doth produce reaſons, why he ſhould ſpare <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that becauſe it was no Family, or Village, or Burrough, but a City; and no obſcure vulgar City, whoſe ſtreets were ſhort, lanes ſtreight, buildings low, or compaſs narrow, but a vaſt, large, <hi>great City;</hi> yea, match all the Cities upon earth, yet, as the Poet ſaid, <hi>Let Rome be to me inſtead of all;</hi>

ſo <hi>Nineveh</hi> had the precedency, and preheminency, it was the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated and magnified City, <hi>That great City.</hi> But will ſome ſay, We ſhall know a City by the City-rarities, are there any things to be found in it?

fore-paſt happineſſe is rather anguiſh then ſolace, miſery then honour; what therefore, hath not this City been flouriſhing, but is now decayed and deſolate? no, it is in the ſtanding beauty, it is for the preſent magnificent, for <hi>there are.</hi> Are? what are there? gorgeous ſtructures, rich merchandiſes, but ſcarce inhabitants to dwel, or trade in it? no, there are <hi>Perſons.</hi> Perſons? but in what numbers? if a man take the ſum of them, is there any large tale to be brought in?

Oh thou haſt an heart of flint, if theſe things do not melt it; thou art no man, and worſe then a beaſt, if the deſtruction of ſo many Infants, and ſo much Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, do not make thee relent.

               <p>As I have for a while joyned both theſe parts together, ſo now I muſt ſever them, and begin firſt with the nature of the place, <hi>That great City.</hi> Wherein there are three things conſiderable

               <p>Fourthly, Cities are places of <hi>Arts and Sciences:</hi> for in the Country there are none but Heardſmen, and Tilthmen to be found; but in the City is the <hi>Cunning Artificer,</hi> a man, which doth find out intricacies, out of whoſe brain do come all the rare inventions upon earth; now the <hi>Only wiſe God</hi> will he deface thoſe places, where ſo much pregnancy; and acrimony of with doth abound?</p>

No, for theſe reaſons <hi>God will ſpare Cities.</hi> It is true, <hi>There is no evill in the City, but the Lord hath done it,</hi> but that evill doth not come in haſte, but with much protraction, and delay to a City, the City uſually feeleth of it in the laſt place; God doth land his judgements upon the Shores ſide, and doth make them take a long march through the Country, before they do pitch down their Tents, dig Trenches, lay ſtreight ſieges, and ſet up ſcaling ladders againſt the City. Indeed if a City doth live out of fear, live in pleaſure, and dwell careleſsly, if the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96669:91"/>Harp, the Viole, the Tabret, the Pipe, the wine, be in their Feaſts, if they deride, and defy judgements, then God may fray the City in the midſt of her joviſance, caſe up her muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtruments, bring in the voider to her ſumptuous Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, turn this dancing City into a ſorrowfull Lady, yea, make this melodious City a <hi>Ramah,</hi> wherein there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>but mourning, and weeping, and great lamentation;</hi> inſtead of the mirth, and the jollity of the City, <hi>the cry of the City ſhall go up to Heaven.</hi> 1 Sam. 5.12. For if a City wax proud, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, daring, and braving, it ſhall know, that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gates, nor bars, walls, Towers, impregnable Caſtles, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of armed men that ſhall ſecure her, Gods confounding judgements ſhall pull down the moſt potent, and haughty City. <hi>A City of perverſeneſſe,</hi> Ezech. 9.9. ſhall be a City of perplexity. Then <hi>the City ſhall be ſmitten,</hi> Ezech. 33.24. <hi>laid deſolate,</hi> Eſ. 27.10. <hi>made a Den of Dragons.</hi> Jer. 10.22. <hi>a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced City ſhall be made an heap,</hi> Eſ. 25.2. <hi>It ſhall be ſaid, This is the City, which ſhall be viſited,</hi> Jer. 6.6.

But if there be any goodneſſe in the City, <hi>It ſhall be called a City ſought, and not forgotten.</hi> Eſ. 62.12. Yea, <hi>they of the City ſhall flouriſh like the groſſe of the Earth.</hi> Pſal. 72.16. <hi>there ſhall be the poſſeſſion of the City.</hi> Ezech. 48.20. <hi>the City through proſperity ſhall be ſpread abroad.</hi> Eſ. 57.8. <hi>Glorious things ſhall be ſpoken of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Pſ. 87.3.

where is an interchange not onely of goods, but manners.

               <p>Secondly, a City is a place of honour; becauſe there men wind up a clew of meanes in a more noble way than other men; for whereas theſe men (for the moſt part) have no great patrimonies left them, nor fields to till, nor Paſtures to feed; yet by a meer ingenious and artificiall way, they raiſe vaſt Eſtates. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that they are called Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants from <hi>Mercury,</hi>

that <hi>great Godo wit,</hi> that though he be the inventer of all Arts (as ſome hold) yet the Merchant hath the honour to have his name engraven into him; and therefore it was as <hi>Caeſar</hi> thinketh, that he ſaw ſo many Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Merchants built to <hi>Mercury,</hi> as if he were their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deity. <hi>Calepine</hi> expreſly ſaith, That he is called <hi>Hermes,</hi> becauſe he is ſet over Merchandize, and that that calling doth require communication and conference. Yea, as <hi>Hermes Friſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus</hi> borrowed his name from him in Greek, ſo doth the Merchant in Latine. A lofty derivation, and yet the learned Ancients thought they muſt go ſo high to find out the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Merchants. I do not onely find that in latter times, <hi>Laurence Medici</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Rodolph</hi> King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> the Son of the great <hi>Albertus,</hi> that <hi>Pertinax</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as <hi>Petrus Gregorius</hi> reporteth, and <hi>Pſammeticus</hi> King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> affirmeth, were Merchants; and if we can find crowned Merchants, then Merchants muſt be thought to get their meanes in a ſplendid way, for Princes would never ſpot their Courts, and ſoyl their Robes in medling with a ſordid calling. In generall ye ſee, that this perſon doth not hew, and plaiſter, and delve, and drive for his living, but by the near art of contracts, and the curious ſcience of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as it were by wit and pregnancy, he doth advance

If ye would ſee the Map of the world, go to a Citizens ſhop, for Merchandiſe is vaſt, and copious, it bringeth home things from all places, yea from unknown Lands, it filleth the Land with all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's wares and wonders.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96669:94"/>it is the Nations Head-ſervant, High-ſteward, ſent out to all the earth, as to a generall Market, and fairſtead, to buy her proviſions, and things of the higheſt price to furniſh her, and adorn her. And what ſhe meeteth withal for her uſe, ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth home, nay brings in her own hand to her dear City, that the City might be a Spring within her ſelfe, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit to the whole Country; Merchant and Citizen, therefore, ſtill ſtand thy ground with reputation, for thou maiſt be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a perſon of ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a City is a place of honour, becauſe multitudes live there with an unanimous expreſſion; yea many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſands linked like perſons of one Tabernacle; yea many a family not ſo combined as a City, therefore it is called a Society or a Corporation.</p>

and <hi>Diſcord brought the ruine.</hi> So indeed, to cement and ſecure a City, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then Concord; True Citiſens they have their City in high veneration, and though there be many thouſands of them, yet they all bow to the honour of the City, as to a common Parent; for he is an unnaturall child, that can tread upon the feet of his own Mother, or gripe her hand, or break her head; a ſeditious perſon which hath nothing but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver in his brain, and <hi>Aquafortis</hi> on his toung, reaſoning, and arguing quite contrary to the grounds of City-ſafety, he ſeemeth not to be a Citiſen, or one of thoſe lovely children which her eye doth look upon with pleaſure; but an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite, which ſhe hath brought forth to her griefe, all rightbred Citiſens looking to the glory and wellfare of the City with a kind of ſacred reverence; therefore ſeeing ſuch infinitenumbers can live together in ſuch admired unity, all conſpiring to vote up the Cities Weal, and dignity, a Citiſen (if right) is a Worthy, and may be looked upon as a perſon of Renown.</p>

and ſevere againſt the reception of perſons unto the Titles of Citiſens, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when his Daughter <hi>Livia</hi> was a Petitioner for a Tributary Frenchman to be made free, he out of reſpect to the Law, would only exempt him from taxes, but not make him a Citiſen, ſaying, that he had rather his Exchequer ſhould ſuffer, then the dignity of the Citybe eclipſed. This Freeman then, that ſees others, onely walk upon the ſtones of the ſtreets, or gaze upon the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſhews, or ſalute acquaintance, or ſleep in an hired lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or pay penniworths for the coſtly Wares which the City doth afford but cannot lay claim to the leaſt immunity, when the Citiſen himſelfe doth riſe up every morning with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of rights, and hath priviledges meeting him in every
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96669:96"/>corner; and hath the City-liberties in all places attending upon him, how can he but be eyed as one conſpicuous? yes, he is the eminent Citizen, even for his enfranchiſement.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A City is a place of honour, becauſe there are degrees of honour, the Livery, the golden Chain, the Bench. St <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſaid <hi>he was a Citizen of no mean City,</hi> Act. 21.29. doth infer, that that City had high offices, and places of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it, for <hi>no mean City</hi> doth declare no mean Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and jurisdiction to belong to the City; there were thoſe <hi>that ſerved the City,</hi> Ezech. 48.18. as if the City commanded like a Maſter. How was Jeruſalem once <hi>great amongſt the Nations, and Princeſs amongst the Provinces?</hi> Lamen. 1.1. <hi>Heph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zibah,</hi> and <hi>Beulah,</hi> how did they ſhine in principality and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectures? It is ſaid, That they ſhall be as a crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, yea as a royal Diadem, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 62.3. And wherefore? but that the Citizens there ſhall have a kind of Majeſtick power; not onely goods, but government; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes, but magiſtracy; not onely degrees of Eſtate, but degrees of honour: Citizens are ever upon the riſing hand, and coming to places of preferment; elſewhere men may get ample fortunes, and raiſe great Families; but here is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and regiment, dignity and domination, promotion and preſidency, the City Veſt, and the City Sword to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Alexander ab Alexandrio</hi> ſaith that the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> had two Tribes for men to riſe to honour by,
<note place="margin">Alex. <hi>ab</hi> Alex. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note>
which were called <hi>Aegida,</hi> and <hi>Pitana;</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> had three tribes, which were called <hi>Godeontae, Ergadae,</hi> and <hi>Hoplitae,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith;
<note place="margin">Plut. <hi>in</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Alex. <hi>ab</hi> Alex. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 18. Blondes <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Romae trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantis.</hi>
                  </note>
The City of <hi>Megara</hi> had ſive tribes, which were called <hi>Heraci, Piraci, Megarenſes, Traſpodicei, Cynoſurei;</hi> and as <hi>Blondus</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the <hi>Romans</hi> had five and thirty tribes. And is there any City that have not their ſeverall Orders, ſtates, and degrees, whereby men are going up by ſteps to the top of preferment? Yes, a Citizen is a graduall creature, that is ever footing it through all the motions of advancement and dignity. In <hi>Rome</hi> (except it were by origination, or cooptation) they firſt began at Manumiſſion, when the Maſter laying his hand upon the head of his ſervant, and delivering him up to the Pretor, he was regiſtred for a freeman; aſterwards he was called <hi>ad pileum</hi> to the cap, which was a token of his liberty; then he was called <hi>to the white Garment, the gold Ring, and a new name;</hi> and then he was called <hi>ad togam, tunicam,</hi> to the gown, &amp; coat under it; then to the <hi>curule Chair,</hi> then to <hi>jus imaginis,</hi> to have power to make Images and ſo having paſſed through ſeverall effices of <hi>Aediles, Quaeſtours, Pre ors,</hi> and <hi>Tribunes;</hi> at laſt they became <hi>to be Senators and Conſuls:</hi> And is it not thus in every City? yes, from Freemen, Liverymen, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>councilled
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96669:97"/>at laſt they come to mount up to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of command; and in fine to be chiefe Magiſtrates. Now a Citizen that thus from creeping out of the neſt, doth after fly to the tops of Mountains, and after that doth take an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles flight, is he not to be highly eſteemed? yes, this going from garment to garment, from office to office, from title to title, till at laſt he doth become a <hi>Cities-Maximus,</hi> doth ſhew a Citizen to be an illuſtrious perſon.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, A City is a place of honour in reſpect of large pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Tribute to whom tribute, and cuſtome to whom cuſtome,</hi> Rom. 13.7. Now in defraying tributes and cuſtomes, who doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Citizen? We find that <hi>Solomon,</hi> which exceeded all the Kings of the earth in riches, had much of his Royall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue <hi>from the Merchants; and the traffique of the ſpice Merchants,</hi> 1 King. 10.15. The adverſaries of the Jews wrote to <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes,</hi> that he ſhould hinder the building of Jeruſalem, <hi>becauſe the City would pay no toll, tribute, and cuſtome,</hi> Ezrah. 4.12. They ſpeak not of the Country, but their chiefe ſpight is againſt the City, as if the toll tribute and cuſtome did come from the City principally; and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſeduced by that informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned a quick anſwer, by all meanes to obſtruct that deſign; <hi>Give ye now commandment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to cauſe theſe men to ceaſe, and that this City be not builded, for why ſhould damage grow to the hurt of the King?</hi> v. 22. as if his chiefe damage he thought would grow, and accrew, by the City ſubſtracting her wonted payments.

In all great impoſitions laid upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Citizens are chiefly called forth <hi>ad cenſus</hi> to taxes. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nortus</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> as if they knew where their Crown ſtock lay, they wrote only unto Cities, to ſee that there ſhould be no diminution of the accuſtomed payments. <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Demetrius Polycrates,</hi> got a thouſand two hundred talents from Cities. <hi>Severus Alexander,</hi> who was one of the beſt Emperors, drew his vaſt ſums with which he built his baths, and left ſuch an incredible treaſure to his Children, from Handicraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which lived in Cities. <hi>Zenophon</hi> doth report, That if the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> went to war, the Cities chiefly maintained the Souldiers. In the great Wars that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour had before the Empire was ſettled, all Nations being almoſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered through the charge of three and twenty Armies, that he was enforced at one time (as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith) to maintaine in the field; when he was at his laſt caſt, and knew not where to get money, it was the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by giving him the five and twentieth part of their Eſtates, and ſetting a great Tax upon the ſides of every City-houſe,
<note place="margin">Dion. <hi>in</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſto.</note>
and by large volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Contributions, ſupplyed all his wants; ſo that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the extremity be, the City ſtill muſt bring the remedy:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96669:97"/>it is the Purſe-bearer of the Nation, or the truſty ſurety to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for all exigents. If this Cloud doth not drop, a grievous drought may afflict the Country; if theſe Milch-kine do not give down their milk, there may be nothing to ſeeth for the hungry family; if this Phyſitian doth not adminiſter, the ſick patient may give up the ghoſt; the City is the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Letter, by which we reckon how the year will go about, or the golden number by which we muſt caſt up the accounts for all accidents: Alas, the Citizen, and the Merchant, doth get more (if he hath free trade) in a ſhort time by traffique and commerce, than the Country-man doth in an age by tillage, and the profit of his ground; here are the vaſt gaines, and here muſt be the grand and vaſt diſburſments; the greateſt Princes upon earth are enforced to fly to the banks of their Cities, as their laſt refuge; whenſoever trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure doth fail, they muſt go dig in theſe God-mines. A City was wont to be called the Kings-Chamber, for the ſafety of his perſon, and it may be called the Kings Coffer, to fill his empty hand with ready coyn in <hi>ſpecie;</hi> whatſoever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, here is the Caſhiere, or Paymaſter: Oh then, ſhall a Citizen be reckoned amongſt the <hi>Sporades,</hi> which are Stars ſo obſcure, that their aſteriſms cannot be taken; no, let him go for one of the Stars of the greateſt magnitude in a Nation. Even for payments ſake, the Citizen ought not to be looked on, or ſpoken of, but as a perſon of honour. All that hath been ſaid then being duly conſidered, let no man lift up the Robe of a Citizen with diſdain, nor belch out contempt and ignominy in the face of a Citizen; no the churle is baſe, the Epicure is baſe, the Oppreſſor is baſe, the Boaſter is baſe, the Sycophant is baſe, but the Citizen is honourable; there were Citizens before there were Heraulds, Heaven it ſelfe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a City, or the City of the new Jeruſalem; yea, there needeth no more to ſet out the honor of a City, then that God would ſpare <hi>Nineveh,</hi> becauſe a City: <hi>Should not I ſpare Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh, a City?</hi>

               <p>Thus much in generall, for your ſelves in particular, as God hath made you a City, ſo do ye principle out goodneſſe to the Land: for a ſhame it were for the ſowreſt fruit to grow
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96669:98"/>upon the top-branch, or the worſt Schollars to be in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form. Shall ye be taught duty from abroad? or learn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Country? ſhall the man in ruſſet direct thee in thy furrs? the leathern girdle inſtruct the gold Chain? Shall there be more noble motions, and pious reſolutions in the rurall Swain, then the Citiſen? Shalt thou mind nothing but the vent of thy ware? and the fale of thy merchandiſe? yes, thou haſt another trade to look after; A Citiſen ſhould ſhew to his Cuſtomers the beſt Patterns of holy life, and open the packs of religious preſidents; A City ſhould be the Burſe, and Magazine of vertuous demeanours; or elſe it wil be ſaid, that the Citizen doth ſtudy nothing but himſelfe, and that his Counting-houſe is his conſcience, and his penny his God. Oh therefore God hath given you honour, maintain your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, let the great wheel of vertue ſtir here, and the morning ſtar of grace ſhine here. Let not the mirery waies be cleaner then your paved ſtreets, and the thatched ſhuds be nearer built then your tiled houſes. Let not the Country man, when he commeth amongſt you be lothed with the ſmell of your intemperance, or recoyl at the ſight of your fraud, or bluſh at your neutralizing, or be ready to deride your pride, or to hiſſe at your malice, or to freeze with your indevotion, or to drop down dead with ſeeing the blood of oppreſſion ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the ſtones of your ſtreets; but prepare choiſe ſights for the Country mans eye, that he may go home, and ſay, I have ſeen the Phoenix of religion, the Paradiſe of Piety, the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the Suburbs of Heaven; I have learned grace out of every Citizens mouth, and bought bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains of ſanctity at every ſhop, enough to ſtock my ſelf, and ſupply all my neighbours. Thus ſhall ye ſhew your ſelves to be a flouriſhing City, when ye are as full of Profeſſours, as Traders? and of Saints, as Merchants; when ye have trafficked for godlineſſe at every Port, and fetched home the true Pearl further then the <hi>Indies:</hi> Well remember, that <hi>To whom much is given, of them much will be required.</hi> Ye ſhould have a priority of duty, becauſe ye have a priority of dignity.

Oh then that the City could ſearch her walls, and ſee what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents do lodge in it, yea, go from houſe to houſe and find out all the ſuſpected, dangerous perſons, which haunt this Corporation to work the utter ruine of it, that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would bring to open view more Malefactours, then all the privy ſearches, or lowd cries of the Temple have yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd. It is high time to ſettle upon the work; for if the City be in any hazard, there are grievous ſins in it that do jeopard the welfare, and ſafety of it; God is irritated beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when he is driven to viſit, and doth ſpy in it tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wonderfull, when he is ready to inflict plagues that are wonderfull. <hi>Shalt thou reign becauſe thou art cloſed in Cedar?</hi> ſhalt thou be ſecure, becauſe thou art cloſed about with ſo many propugnacles? no, God may judge this City, and judge it, becauſe it is a City? and what an urging people then are ye, which have turned favour into fury? would God willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſevere? no, vengeance doth never approach till impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is at the height, till <hi>Job, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> can ſave but their own ſouls, and not the places where they dwell, and for which they ſacrifice their averting, and reconciling prayers: Oh think how often ye have ſmitten at Gods face, and wounded his honour, when he is enforced to ſtrike, and ſuch Petitioners cannot bind his hand. Oh ye are Sinners <hi>before the Lord exeeedingly,</hi> when ye have tranſnatured God, changed him from a gracious to an avenging God, for ye ſee he doth take no delight in waſtes, and deſolations; No, this is contrary to his inclination, and propenſion, his tender mercy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, indeified compaſſion, for if your ſins did not turn away his pittifull eye, harden his ſoft bowels, and make him weary with repenting; he would ſpare the City, and that becauſe it is a City, <hi>Should not I ſpare</hi> Nineveh, <hi>a City.</hi>

do ſignificantly expreſſe this, for the one doth come of a root that doth declare, that the thing hath encreaſed, or magnified it ſelf; and the other of a root which doth intimate that the thing is copious, or it hath multiplyed it ſelf; ſo that to be great is no more then a thing grown up, or come to a kind of fulneſſe, and graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I do not ſay, it hath no further to go, but it is gone to a fair diſtance, or waxen ſo wel in the parts, that it is fit to be admired; for how hath the ey a kind of marvelling enter into it at the beholding of that which is great? what ſhould I ſay? if a thing be good, it cannot be to great; no, the more great, the more perfect.

which was to be called after his own name <hi>Nineveh,</hi> of <hi>Ninus,</hi> though ſome call it <hi>Ninoe,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius Niſibis;</hi> and the better to beautify the City, he cauſed all his principall Artificers and the flowre of his Nobility, to come and build here, ſo that it became at laſt the ſplendour of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the Wonder of the whole world. It is true, many learned writers do hold <hi>Ashur,</hi> and <hi>Ninus</hi> to be the ſame perſon, yet by the judgement of very choiſe Authors, the contrary is maintained, <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ninus raiſed up his Fathers little town to be the head of an Empire. Pezelius</hi> out of very good Antiquities doth affirm, that it may be ſafely held that <hi>Ashur gave but the beginning to the City, and that</hi> Ninus <hi>ſet it up in perfect beauty.</hi> Yea, it was <hi>That great Conquerour,</hi> that made it <hi>That great City;</hi> And that it was ſuch a City, I ſhall make evident, not only from forced deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, by which ſome Criticks would aſſert the excellency of the City, as <hi>Nin veh</hi> of <hi>Nave, Fair,</hi> or of <hi>Nava, full of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or from glorious titles, as</p>

as if it were of an heavenly kind of magnitude, as Cedars are called <hi>the trees of God,</hi> for their procerity and loftineſſe; the lofty Cedar, and this lofty City.</p>

                  <hi>Nineveh?</hi> No, <hi>Athens, Thebes, Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, though they ſhone brightly for a time, yet they had their City-eclipſes, ſtrange variations and changes, by direptions and rapines, yea ſad alterations both of Governours and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But this City had no ſuch hurles and ſtate-Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes; but it continued in a quiet, peaceable, and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, ſome ſay for 1500 years, others for 1400, and all agree for above a thouſand; a City that had never feaver, nor convulſion, epilepſy, nor palſie, in ſuch a long decourſe of Ages, how muſt it needs wax, and thrive to the heighth of greatneſſe?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was <hi>that great City,</hi> for the vaſt wealth that was found in it, for <hi>Beleſus</hi> joyning with <hi>Arbaces,</hi> (ſome call him <hi>Arbactus,</hi>

Well then, for <hi>that great Treaſure,</hi> let it be <hi>that great City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That great City,</hi> for the great emulation that was born againſt it; for was not the eminency of <hi>Nineveh</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with much envy? Yes, there were many that did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne the honour and greatneſſe of it, and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Semiramis.</hi> This <hi>Semiramis,</hi> from being a baſe child, as ſome report; from being an expoſed child, as moſt averre; by the mercy of ſhepheards was taken up, and foſtered till ſhe came to ripe years, when appearing to be one of peerleſſe beauty, ſhe was preſented to the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> who being rapt at the ſight of her, received her very joyfully, and thankfully, and within a ſhort time he married her to his eldeſt Son <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> The Viceroy being ſummoned to wait upon <hi>N nus</hi> in an expedition, He, and <hi>Menon,</hi> and <hi>Semiramis,</hi> went along toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (according to the Eaſtern cuſtome) into the Warres, where <hi>Ninus</hi> caſting his eye upon this <hi>Semiramis,</hi> he thought her too rich a Jewel for a ſubject to wear, and took her home
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96669:111"/>to his Cabinet, yea forced her, and wreſted her from <hi>Menon,</hi> (for which he ſtrangled himſelfe) and made her his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bride and bed-fellow, being enamoured upon her more then he was upon all the other rare beauties which attended on him, or were his amorous eye-marks, or his luſtful Baths. <hi>Semiramis</hi> ſeeing her perfect conqueſt, that ſhe had the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelfe in fetters, made uſe of her opportunity and authority; ſhe ſecretly therefore envying the glory of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and ambitious in her ſelfe to raiſe up a Pile of her own, that ſhould out-beam <hi>Nineveh;</hi> ſhe begged this boon of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that ſhe might have liberty to build a City her ſelfe, her Prince being wholly at her devoyre, and not able to deny her any thing, he granted her ſuit,

and furniſhed her with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to build where ſhe would, and what ſhe would, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixeth upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> and beſtowed ſo much coſt in building, that ſhe thought to make it the mirrour of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and the Nymph of Cities. Indeed the walles ſhe made ſo admirable, that they were eſteemed as one of the wonders of the world; in the reſt of the buildings, her pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition had radiant reflexes; But becauſe the ſaw that ſhe had a reſtraint in her boundleſſe deſires, ſo long as <hi>Ninus</hi> lived; therefore ſhe preſented a ſecond Petition, and that was, that he would give her leave to ſtep out of the Bed-chamber into the Throne, and to raign as abſolute Prince for ſome ſhort time: ſome ſay, it was but for one day, others for two, others for five; <hi>Ninus</hi> infatuated with paſſionate affection, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed that Petition too; oh fatall thing for a Prince, for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Scepter out of his hand, or to give away his Crown for an hour! for <hi>Semiramis</hi> in this ſtint of Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt minute of her command was expired, got her Husband to be made away, and murthered; Oh prodigious new Prince! what miſchiefe may be done in the ſpace of a few punctilioes? Well, <hi>Semiramis</hi> being footlooſe, wading through her Husbands blood to the bank of Principality; ſhe dedicated all the treaſures he had left her, to the ſhrine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; Babylon</hi> is decked and adorned with all the Jewels of the Crown, which ſhe could ſpare. But becauſe vaſt expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will drayn even Princes Coffers; for where the Veſſell is alwayes running, at laſt it will be drawn out to the dregs, therefore <hi>Semiramis</hi> finding a decay of riches, ſhe goeth forth to dig in the Gold-mines abroad.

Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was not like to our Cities in</hi> Europe, <hi>but it did exceed them all, which of them ſoever have had the greateſt fame, and renown;</hi> So that now ye ſee what is ſpoken here by the Spirit of God concerning <hi>Nineveh,</hi> is no hyperbole, as when we ſay that a thing is whiter then ſnow, ſweeter then holly, clearer then the Noon-day; No, man may have his nimieties of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his diffluences, redundances, ſuperjections, and tranſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of ſpeech, but the Scripture doth not blandiſh, over-phraſe, extra-fame any thing; truth it ſelf cannot falſify, <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> here hath from God but her juſt commendation; for it was ſingular, and ſupreme, <hi>a great City,</hi> and <hi>That great City.

               <p>From hence obſerve, that <hi>Eminency hath an eminent reſpect with God Almighty,</hi> he is loth to pluck down that City, which he hath ſuffered to riſe up to the heighth of greatneſſe. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was become a prime City, <hi>the joy of the whole Earth, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of beauty,</hi> &amp; how doth our Saviour weep, when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> weep? why weep? what, is he offended at ſuch a delectable object? do the Towers, or the Bulwarks, the Fort of <hi>Sion,</hi> or the Temple grieve his eyes? no, he doth weep, becauſe he was to ſhed the firſt tears, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ere long was to weep her ſelf blind, to weep her ſelf dead; it was an antient City, and ſhe was now crumbling away to her firſt duſt, it was a great City, and ſhe was now demoliſhing to her firſt ſtone yea, <hi>Not one ſtone ſhall be left upon another;</hi> the very thought of her miſery makes our Saviour cry out, <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou haſt killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them which were ſent unto thee;</hi> that blood wil fetch out all the blood in thy veines, thoſe ſtones will daſh out thine own brains; thou wouldſt not be gathered, therefore thou ſhalt be ſcattered; thou wouldſt not come under my wings, therefore thou ſhalt fall under other Nation's claws; thou hadſt an houſe, but <hi>thy houſe ſhall be left deſolate unto thee:</hi> Thus ye ſee that though <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> had been the Cutthroat, and Executioner of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96669:113"/>yet becauſhe ſhe had been a place of eminency, it cannot but grieve him to ſee how ſhee hath brought this blood of Martyrdome upon her ſelf, to guſh to death with the blood of revenge, and how her ſtones of perſecution will be the ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heap that will cruſh the head of a whole City with direfull curſes; Chriſt cannot think of this accident without grones, nor look upon this ſad fate without tears. <hi>Ephraim</hi> had been another famous City? &amp; how is God pained to the heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Ephraim</hi> in danger? <hi>When</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſpake, there was trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> ſure I am, when God doth ſpeak againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> there is trembling. <hi>Ephraim is joined to Idols, let her alone; alone?</hi> how long? ſee how ſoon God doth renew his preſence, and pitty to <hi>Ephraim. Thou haſt gone, ſaith God, to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to King</hi> Jareb, <hi>and theſe could not heal thee;</hi> But what ſhall <hi>Ephraim</hi> be without remedy? theſe cannot heal thee, ſhall none heal thee? yes, alas ſick <hi>Ephraim!</hi> if thou wilt, thou ſhalt not yet feſter to death in theſe wounds, I (ſaith God) offer to be thy Phyſitian. <hi>Oh</hi> Ephraim <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> Hoſ. 6.4. He will teach <hi>Ephraim</hi> his own, ſhame him in his exorbitances, repreſent to him, what a mixed piece, and a clammy patch he is become, a meer Time-ſerver, and Newter, <hi>Ephraim is mixed amongſt the people, a cake not turned.</hi> Hoſ 7.8. yea, he will call him ſimple to his face, <hi>Ephraim is a ſilly Dove without heart.</hi> v. 11, yea, and he will plead kindneſſe to him, ask <hi>Ephraim,</hi> if this be the fruit of his affection, inſtruction, protection? Oh <hi>Ephraim</hi> did I never do thee any courteſies? was I never uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and beneficiall to thee? yes, <hi>I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>to go, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the armes, I drew him with the cords of a man, with the hands of love, and I was as one that took off the yoak from his jaws, and laid meat unto him.</hi> Hoſ. 11.3.4. Thus God will hint defection, accuſe of folly, and intimate favour, he will counſell, and chide, admoniſh, and rebuke, rather than he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and reject; he will never leave, till <hi>Ephraim</hi> leave old ſtrayings, and come to new tracks, till <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols? I have heard, and obſerved him, I am like a green firr tree, from me is thy fruit found.</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. yea, when God is conſtrained to be rough againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> how is it as if a Father ſhould diſhinherit, or tear out the bowells of his own heir? <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Son? is he my pleaſant child? ſince I ſpake againſt him, I earneſtly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him.</hi>

No, to call up a prudent perſon, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the founder. <hi>The man of wiſdome ſhall ſee his name.</hi> But what ſuch need of this cry? or this man? What? great need, for the City is ready to be carried to the Correction-houſe, to be led to the whipping-pillar, for there is a rod prepared, and the hand lifted up to ſtrike; danger indeed, what ſhall procure the deliverance? is there any meanes left to keep the City from the laſh? Yes? ſaith God, if the City hath but a good ear, ſhe need not fear her back; ſhe ſhall not ſuffer, if ſhe can but hearken, or feel the Rod, if ſhe can but liſten to the Rod, therefore <hi>hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> Thus ye ſee how the City is tutored, that it might not be tortured; and admoniſhed, that it might not be aboliſhed; and directed, that it might not (as they call it) be Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. What endeavour is there to propulſe judgement? to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert vengeance? to ſave the City from the Rod? not the Lords yerk firſt ſcourgeth the City, but <hi>the Lords voyce cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the City.</hi> If it be an eminent City, there ſhall an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Cry be made unto it. <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaidah</hi> were great Cities, for <hi>great things were done in them; great things</hi> have their large commenſurations, they will raiſe up Cities to be quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative, according to the proportion of their favours, the moyety and degree of their excellencies have an accrument; ſpirituall Prerogatives mount Cities higher then the ſpires of their buildings; and the higheſt verticals of their ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and proſperous negotiations.

But is there not a great reckoning to be made for the neglect of theſe <hi>great things?</hi> yes, remember if ye be not great Proficients, ye will be great Sufferers. I would not have you be ſo, why will ye be ſo? what, <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> Grandees in gifts, and Perpuſilloes in fruits? this is to turn white into black, light into darkneſſe, augmentation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diminution, great into little.

But I doubt ye darken your own ſplendor, or diminiſh your own portion, ye ſee not the Sun which doth ſhine amongſt you, ye mark not the rich Commodities which are landed at your own ſtathes, ye cannot tell the price of your City-ſword, nor know not the worth of your Cap of Maintenance; it is too likely, that ye leave all to the City Remembrancer, inſomuch that one at the Lands end is as well acquainted here, as ye are, with your own City. I am afraid ye have given over perambulation to know the bounds of your City, or that ye maintain a City-ſcowt onely to diſcover things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but have not a City-Accountant to bring you in a full ſum of your yearly bleſſings Here ye are ſetled, but ye deſerve not to be thus houſed; here ye are mured in, but your walls are too good for you; God might give away this City to new dwellers, that would ſay, their lot is fallen unto them in a fair ground, or create new members of this Incorporation that would ſing an hymne to him for ſuch variety of bleſſings.

But oh let no man tell you the name of your own City, or take for you the altitude of your own greatneſſe; do not travell into the Country to ask what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is here apparent; nor ſail abroad to enquire what ye do enjoy at home.

&amp; the ſword and pole-axe brought forth for the other: oh what murthers &amp; maſſacers, have there happened at the deſtruction of many Cities. The Citizens of <hi>Eretria</hi> being incloſed as it were in a net, were all put to the ſword. The Citizens of <hi>Scotuſſa</hi> (in <hi>Theſſaly</hi>) being called forth into the Market-ſtead, to hear the lawes of conqueſt, which they were to obſerve; the elder men were made away by Bowmen and Dartmen,

which lay in ſecret to murther them; their young men in a more barbarous way, hewn in pieces, and the women and children ſold for ſlaves under
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96669:120"/>the Crown, as they called it; the City of <hi>Sybaris</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> which had once five and twenty Cities under the jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and did lead out againſt the <hi>Crotoniates</hi> above an hundred thouſand men, being at laſt taken by theſe Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; they were for the moſt part drowned by the River, which they let into the City, and thoſe which eſcaped that death, periſhed by the ſword of the Souldiers. Yea, it is well that they ſuffered but a common death, for in many places they were put to death with torture and extremity. M. <hi>Fulvius</hi> by the counſail of <hi>Pollia,</hi> did not onely kill the <hi>Tuſculanes,</hi> but firſt whipped them moſt grievouſly,

and then ſtrook off their heads with an Axe. The <hi>Locrenſes</hi> firſt defiled the bodies of their Captives with luſt, then they thruſt ſharp needles into their fingers ends, holding them a long time in paine, then they beat them to death in a Morter, and caſt them into the Sea. <hi>Lucius Catilin,</hi> was wont to deſtroy his enemies, firſt by breaking their armes and thighes, then by cutting off their eares,

Yea, and to turn over unto you one leafe more of this black book, they which will not ſpare your walls, and bodies, will they your goods? no, theſe were the foment of the War, or the leading ſtaffe of the march; they hold up their Speares for prey, and ſight for booty.

That though perhaps many men care not what become of conſcience, that if they could keep their walls, skins, and purſes, they would pawn their ſoules to any Broker, they have a Religion ſitted for any ages and accidents. Yet they to whom profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is dearer then the right eye, and the purity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell then the life-blood; is not this an heavy puniſhment?

Therefore let us plead out our own entail to felicity, and bring it home to the proper place, as <hi>Nineveh</hi> here had it rightly ſeared; for, <hi>Wherein.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this doth ſhew that ſome do enjoy diſtinct fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; for though this were no where elſe to be ſeen, yet in <hi>Nineveh</hi> it was to be found, <hi>Wherein. The Lord doth rain upon one City,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this doth ſhew, that greatneſſe doth not conſiſt in bare title, but in effectuall demonſtration, for <hi>Nineveh</hi> is not only <hi>That great City,</hi> but that great <hi>Receptacle, Wherein.</hi> To have <hi>a name to live, and to be dead,</hi> is to be but a great ſtinking Carrion. <hi>If a man thinketh himſelf to be ſomthing, and is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf.</hi> Gal. 6.3. that is, he is but the great Cheat of himſelf; for, for all his great thoughts, he is but the great <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-Nothing.</hi> They are not leaves, but fruits, which juſtify the figtree, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.19. they are not fancies, but fruition, which reallize comfort. <hi>There are a generation of men, which are pure in their own eyes,</hi> but if their purity do reach no further then their own fight, they are the botches of the World; their own eyes ſee that in them, which is not elſewhere viſible; they are Saints of their own glimmering, their purity doth not reach beyond their own eylids. The young man, that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternall life,</hi> muſt not think to carry eternall life with a grand queſtion; no, this is but like a young mans vapour, or a buſy headed Critick; eternall life doth require more then ſcepticall Divinity; hee muſt be as great in acting, as he was in ſcrupling, or elſe that will happen to him which did happen to the young Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>to go away ſorrowfull.</hi> It is not enough to ſay with <hi>Laodicea, I am rich, and encreaſed with goods, and ſtand in need of nothing,</hi> but we muſt be as rich in conſcience, as we are in confidence, or elſe <hi>Laodicea</hi>'s doom will light upon us, <hi>to be wretched, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

Yea, he would <hi>ſet our Tabernacle in the Sun.</hi> For <hi>God doth not alter with times, and chances, being made another than he was, but he doth remain unchangeable in the moſt changeable conditions.</hi> As it is ſaid of <hi>Portius Latro,</hi> that what he undertook he never gave it over, till he had perfected it; ſo Gods providence is as conſummative, as operative: he would not onely be the God of comforts, but the God of conſtancy; not the God of <hi>Aydes,</hi> but the God of <hi>Ages,. I am that I am,</hi> immutable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable. And is this nothing to have interminable felicity? Yes, <hi>Ever to ſtand, and never to fall, is a divine and miraculous thing.</hi> Yet this might be our fixed ſtate, if we would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate our obedience; we might weave out our web to the laſt thred, write <hi>Decades</hi> of felicity. God would never diſturb or interrupt our happineſſe, if our ſinnes did not moleſt or diſquiet him. Oh what a diuturnity and indeſinency of bliſs might there be, even from generation to generation.

It grieveth me to ſee with what wonder ye do look upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, with what contempt upon your Citiſens; with what care ye do preſerve other things, with what diſdeign ye do overlook theſe in their extremities; with what wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ye do eſchew injury to thoſe things, which do tend to your magnificence, with what vioſence ye do puſh at theſe with thigh, and ſhoulder, and beat them to pieces.

that all the Articles of faith are explicitely to be belived, and <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> ſaith, that by diſtinct faith the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the myſtery of the Incarnation, all the principal articles in the Creed, and all points needfull for the ordering of life, and working aright are to be believed by an unfolded faith, and <hi>Pezantius</hi> is ſo large, that he ſaith the Articles touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unity, eſſence, and Trinity of the perſons, Creation, Remiſſion, eternall life, the Nativity, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and ſecond comming of Chriſt, Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, Confeſſion, the ten Commandements, the prayers in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm are clearly, and neceſſarily to be believed. So that an entire faith is not an implicated thing, reſtrained to one
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96669:147"/>thing, out the generall is made very diſtributive, and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in many ſingular, and particular things; yet this entireneſs of faith do I hold but only in things neceſſary, not acceſſary to ſalvation, I mean for the evidence of faith; for faith being of things not ſeen, and faith and knowledge being two diſtinct habits, a man may believe many things that he doth not know, as the Scripture ſaith expreſſely for the joyes of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. knowledge is inſeperable from faith in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as they are revealed either in themſelves, or to us; but not ſo in Eccleſiaſtical propoſitions, and tendries, except they be (due diligence being uſed) very perſpicuouſly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is an hard thing for the beſt Church to have a full ſpirituall anointing, to prophecy upon matters of faith like the Holy Ghoſt, and to write out her decrees with the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam. For ſeeing the whole Catholick Church cannot make one new Article of faith, I believe ſhe is limited in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and as the Angels have not perfect knowledge, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſtate; ſo the Church hath not abſolute, and compleat underſtanding. Therefore if an humble Beleever in theſe things ſhould have obſcurity and darkneſſe, not to bring in a poſitive affirmation, I believe it is no very damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance; for he doth not underſtand, and he <hi>Cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi> So that ye ſee both a naturall incapacity, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the matter may excuſe from ſin, and in the third place, the ſtrength of temptation, onely that ſubtill wits may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to evill things, with ſuch a ſpeciouſneſſe of good, that the moſt vertuous man may oftentimes be led away; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a pure ignorance both of the law and the fact, and the ſeduced perſon doth not ſuſpect any thing of evill in the attempt,

                  <note place="margin">Sueton.</note>
it was not lawfull to put to death Virgins, whilſt they continued in their virginity, he would cauſe them firſt to be deflowred by the Executioner, and then to be ſtrangled; yea, guiltleſsneſſe in thoſe days was ſo little a protection, that if perſons were but queſtioned, they would either ſtab their ſelves at home, or drink poyſon in the open Court, rather then ſuffer his bloody ſentence to paſſe upon them; And oh that Chriſtiany had taught us more juſtice! Are there none in other Lands, though Chriſtian, that dye upon ſuſpitions, and ſuffer for ſuch things that they know not of, but the firſt notice of the crime coms from the lips of a deſperate witneſs? Is innocency or ignorance any ſparing plea? are not many made tranſgreſſors for a word, and for ſuch a word as hath a ſiniſter interpretation from the intention of the ſpeaker? or, if ſome do but tranſgreſs, is not a community oftentimes endangered, which never knew, nor heard any thing of the deſign? if men be but accuſed, is it not enough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? doth it ſtand with the honour of a Bar, to diſmiſs them as guiltleſſe perſons which appear before it? Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is large, and it ſeemeth to teach all the world truth and virtue, but I doubt all her Pulpits have not ſanctified her judgement ſeats; the ſouls under the Altar groan, and I am afraid the blood under the Tribunalls do cry.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this doth reprove them which ſin againſt their own <hi>Diſcernings,</hi> which can diſcern, and do diſcern, and yet their <hi>words are ſtout againſt God.</hi> Mal. 3.12. <hi>they are Cockatrices, that will not be charmed.</hi> Jer. 7.17. they treſpaſſe againſt their inward checks, and ſin againſt the very impulſions of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

no, they have nothing but the beams of their own deſignes, which do ſhine bright in their eyes: as <hi>Ibancus,</hi> when <hi>Alexius Angelus</hi> ſent <hi>Alexius Palaeolagus</hi> with the open Bible in his hand to reclaim him from his Inſurrection, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Priſon with the Scripture in his hand; ſo it is enough to deſerve fetters, to urge Scripture.

                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 2.43.</note>
an oath is <hi>a bond upon the Soul,</hi> but theſe bonds are as eaſily broken as <hi>Sampſon</hi> brake the cords of the Philiſtines; For, for all the ſolemn oaths in the daies of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus Comnenus,</hi> and <hi>Iſaacius Porphyro genitus,</hi> mens teeth were pulled out,

their lips cut off, and the envied perſons thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dungeons: Oaths in thoſe daies were a low fence which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men could eaſily leap over.

<note place="margin">Valer M. l. 9. c. 5.</note>
and the cry of all Chriſtendom. Yea, if the Authors which did act theſe things in thoſe daies, were men which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96669:150"/>had pretended ſo much piety, that a man would have thought the confirmed Angels could as ſoon have fallen from their ſtedfaſtneſſe, as they from the honour of their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what did they but ſuch things, as except they ſhould have ſtrooke at the face of God, and endeavoured to pluck the Crown from his head, deny him, and diſavow him, they could not have done worſe; and by what inſtruments did they effect theſe things? by ſuch, as unleſſe they had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tools from <hi>Cyclops</hi> himſelfe, more fatall Engines could not have been employed; and for what ends did they do it? not to clenſe religion, for the Church if it had before a little ſoyl in it, did in their daies become a ſink, but it was to gather wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls, and to warm themſelves at the flame of combuſtions; and where did they it? even in the Land of their Nativity, and in the birth-place of their Chriſtianity; and when did they it? even when all Nations ſtood admiring the bliſſe of the Land, and no doubt the very Angels of Heaven rejoiced over the proſperity, and zeal of the Church.

I ſhall not ſtand upon the curious obſervations which many have inſiſted upon, as that God hath compleatly furniſhed us, in giving us two feet, two eyes, and two hands; and that ſome things are more ſerviceable to God Almighty then others, as our right hand to us is more uſefull then the left; and that by the right hand and left, we ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween truth and falſhood; and many the like ſtrange conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drawn out of theſe words, which I ſhal paſs over, becauſe I hold them too ſubtile ſpeculations.

Before the child ſhall know, then he did not alwaies know. And if Chriſt muſt have time to exert his wiſdome, what other childe at firſt can be compleat?

I do not like them which fright men of riper age with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing ſcruples, that no man can be ſaved but thoſe which have ſwum through their whirle-pool, but I tremble to ſee an <hi>Euripus</hi> prepared for Infants; that they will neither let them have peace for themſelves, nor their infants. Alas poor Infants, when ye are baſtardiſed in the arms of your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, or diſinherited when your elder Brother hath taken you by the hand, and acknowledged you for co-heirs. Have ye no certain intereſt in heaven, by the virtue of the ſeal? may ye be damned with the blood of Chriſt trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon your ſoules? is the Covenant of no validity to you? is not the Ordinance an undoubted pledge of your juſtification? No marvell then that many ſay, that they are
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96669:155"/>above Ordinances, when the power of the Ordinance is ſo much diſparaged amongſt our ſelves; what, Infants ſlayn at the Font? and left to the Devill with the purgative waters upon their faces? Why then do they baptize them at all? or adminiſter to them the Phyſick, if they their ſelves doubt of the operation of it. <hi>Eſay</hi> no doubt, had more confidence in his plaiſter of figs, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> in ſending of <hi>Naaman</hi> to go waſh in the River of <hi>Jordan.</hi> Is a miniſteriall act ſo full of ſuſpence? then why are they miniſters, if they unpower, caſſate their own function? Have they received true Orders? then why do they doubt of the efficacy of the Ordinances? the Parents may as well ſuſpect, whether they can, or do baptize; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether they have a lawfull calling, and execute it lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as they perplex the Parents, in ſaying, That if their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be baptized, they cannot tell, but that they may drop into hell from the Sacrament, if they dye Infants. Cannot they tell? then let them tell me nothing upon my Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couch, that can tell ſo little comfort at the laver. I confeſſe I ſhould be loath to take my Abſolution from them at my laſt gaſp in the world, that can give ſo little reſolution at the firſt breath in Chriſtianity. St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was ſaid to be <hi>Darus pater Infantum, The hard Father of Infants,</hi> becauſe he denyed heaven to Infants not being baptized; but are not theſe more unkind Fathers, which will not aſcertain heaven to Infants when they are baptized? The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which held no Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin, held Baptiſm requiſite for an outward admiſſion into a Church; and do theſe hold Original ſin, and ſhall Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm give but an externall initiation into a Church viſible? a viſible fallacy (to ſpeak in the mildeſt terms) to attribute to Baptiſme no more, then a Pelagian priviledge. If theſe doe not judge Originall ſin to be <hi>leviſſimum peccatum, the lighteſt ſin,</hi> then this is <hi>graviſſimum peccatum, a moſt grievous ſin,</hi> to ſay Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin doth remain, though Infants be baptized. If Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hath no more virtue, they had, for an heavenly intereſt, as good bid the Father to go waſh the Infant at a Pond, or the Mother to go rinſe it at a Conduit; for the Infant gets no other qualifications, if it do live, but onely to have liberty to enter a Church, and communicate with the faithfull, and ſit down at the Table of the Lord; all, outward and common. But what is this to the ſoul? to everlaſting bliſſe? that if the Infant dye an Infant, the Parent may but weep for the Ioſſe of Nature, and not ſhed teares for the ſpirituall detriment; yea, that the Infant may be parted withall with comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath let it live, till baptiſm had graffed it into a Saviour: oh the ſoul of a Parent is never out of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till the ſoul of the child be out of a ſtate of guilt; the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96669:156"/>thought of a damned child, makes the Parent halfe in hell with his deceaſed Infant. I have ſeen the portraicture of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels upon a Font, but I abhor to ſee the Devill pictured there; the Holy Ghoſt came down viſibly upon Chriſt at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and was not this an earneſt of the Holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down inviſibly upon the baptized? St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth put a queſtion,

I demand (ſaith he) <hi>Whether any one would deny Baptiſm to be admitted, or would be in ſuch an errour, as to ſay it was admitted in vain. Baptiſm doth make of miery perſons, men pure gold. By holy baptiſm we are circumciſed from ſin. L t us aſcend out of the waters, as the living from the dead, being ſaved by the grace of him which called us.</hi> In Baptiſm, the Devil doth loſe all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his wickedneſſe. In Baptiſme, the black Raven, the Devill being ſent forth, and not returning, the Dove (the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt) doth bring the Olive-branch of peace. Thus the Fathers do proclaim the infallible effect of Baptiſm upon the preſent adminiſtration. Yea, why were the Baptiſed in the Primitive Church called <hi>Fideles</hi> the faithful, but that they held them certainly Beleevers? and <hi>Illuminati,</hi> Illuminates, but that they reſolved that the light of grace was entered into them? and <hi>Neophyti, New Plants,</hi> but that they were perſwaded that they were tranſplanted out of Hell into Heaven? yea, why was the white baptiſmall garment put upon them, but that they abſolutely concluded, that they were in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and prepared for a ſtate of glory? to pollute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vertue of Baptiſm is worſe then the filth that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius Copronymus</hi> left behind him in the <hi>Font.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh therefore preach up the honour of Baptiſm, and preach comfort to the ſouls of Parents concerning their Baptiſed Infants; what obſtacle can there be to exclude them from grace? I find but theſe Impediments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there be not an unlawfull Miniſter; then if ye can juſtifie your calling, why do ye not juſtifie your act?</p>
               <p>Secondly an undue adminiſtration; then if ye be ſtrict in the matter, and have invented no new form, why do ye not aſſure the effect?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a want of a foederal right; then if ye will not make Chriſtians Infidels, why ſhould ye deny the ſaving vertue of the Ordinances to their Children?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that there be no infidelity, or diſſimulation, and how can theſe <hi>diffidere, diſtruſt,</hi> that know not what it is to miſbelive? or be <hi>ficti, feigned perſons,</hi> that are unskilled in arts, or crafts, which <hi>know not their right hand from their left?</hi> All the ſtumbling blocks being then removed, why ſhould we not

                  </gap>e truth, for if the Sacrament of Baptiſm be not onely ſignificative, and obſignatory, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive, and applicatory; if God be never ſeparated from Baptiſm juſtly adminiſtred, if Chriſt and his paſſion be the ſubſtance of that Sacrament, if that Sacrament hath an equal effect in all, if a perſon loſe the ſtein of all guilts in thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and there be not onely a cleanſing and purifying, but a beautifying, and brightning allution, inſomuch that characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing graces are beſtowed upon the baptiſed; if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated not onely into the Church, but into Chriſt; if they be paſt the gates of Hell, and the gate of Heaven doth ſtand open to them; then why ſhould we dry up the waters of Baptiſm upon the foreheads, or raſe the Coeleſtiall prints out of the ſouls of baptiſed Infants? Why ſhould we ſmother theſe children in the lap of the Church? or pluck away theſe children from the knees of their Mother, ſo ſoon as ſhe hath given them her bleſſing: Why ſhould we not call theſe Chriſts ſheep, when we find the ear-mark of his paſſion upon them?

which ſaith, <hi>That no man ſhall think, that any detriment ſhall come to their Children by deferring Confirmation; for he ſhall know for truth, that it is certain by Gods word, that children being baptized, have all things neceſſary for their ſalvation, and be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſaved.</hi> I know the main ſeruple in oppoſition to this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout election, that if any Infant were not decreed from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to be ſaved, his Baptiſm wil nothing avail him, but it is evident that theſe were elected, for God ſuffered them to live ſo long, till they were baptiſed, and ſo made members of Chriſts myſticall body; therefore if they ſhould dy inſtantly after they have been hallowed by the Sacrament, their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a confirmation of their Election, and that not onely by the judgement of Charity but by the judgement of Certainty wee may pronounce and determine, that the Ordinance hath purged them, and will crown them; Oh therefore leave tearing open a bleeding wound, and caſting wildfire into the flames of a Parents burning heart, to double his diſtreſſes for the loſſe of his dear Infant, as if it were dead, and may be damned; no, bleſſe your own work, looſe not the conſecration of your own fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ye have the commiſſion to baptiſe as well as to preach; ſhew the parent Heaven for his Soul in your Pulpit, ſhew him Heaven for the Soul of his Infant in the Laver, aſſure him that his deceaſed child is flown to Heaven with Ordinance-wings. The Infant hath been clenſed in the Church, and what can it do afterwards to deſerve Hell? what corrupted
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96669:157"/>underſtanding diſordered will, or miſguided affections can an Infant have? it is free from guilt, for it is free from evill motions; it knows not how to provoke, for it knows not how to ſin; oh therefore ſpare them, whom God would ſpare; God would not deſtroy Infants, becauſe Infants cannot diſcern; they cannot diſcern criminall things, for they cannot diſcern ſmall things; <hi>they cannot diſcern between their right hand, and their left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cannot diſcern between their right hand, and their left hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this doth ſerve to exhort all (chiefly them which have a ſpecial relation) to tender the eſtate of Infants. For, who ſhould not deal juſtly with them, which underſtand not their own right? who ſhould not diſcern as much as may be for their advantage, which cannot diſcern any thing for their own behoof, not ſo much as <hi>diſcern between their right hand, and their left.</hi> If thou oughteſt <hi>to open thy mouth in the caſe of the dumb,</hi> then much more for them, whoſe tongue ſtrings are not yet unlooſened to plead their own caſe? if thou oughteſt to be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, then much more for them, who have not an eye to read an evidence to ſee the ſtrength of a title, nor a foot to walk to a bar to demand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?

Is this your reveren e to dead aſhes? is this your commiſeration to your ſucklings which want both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and breſt upon the death of the Parents?

All relations of amity, and conſanguinity will not bind men to expreſs theſe faithfull reſpects; The Parent upon his death-Couch is not troubled more with his dying pronges, than with vexatious cares to whom to commit his children; he is afraid of his moſt intimate Aſſociate, he doth dread his nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt kinſman; and well may he: For what fidelity is there to be found amongſt ſworn Familiars, or Allies? if the Father doth intruſt theſe, they may keep the children, but they will make their ſelves Heirs; the Father hath put the moath into the garment, the woolfe into the fold, the cankerworm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the fruits; oh what a poor remainder will there be left after ſuch ſharp teeth no, they will eat out his eſtate, his poſterity, his name? What incredible disburſements, what large bills of account are there brought in at the end of the Terme? what reſtleſſe moleſtations, and chargeable ſuits muſt the Heir be put to before he can recover his right; if this <hi>Helena</hi> be once caught, it will coſt ten years ſiege to regain her.

What therefore doth the Father chooſe theſe for Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours? he had as good ſend his children to the Mortar to be beaten to powder, to the Milſtones to be ground to duſt, to the Shambles to be chopt to pieces, to the Furnace to be burnt up to a few ends of brands. Oh the ſad grones and the piercing cry that there is of oppreſſed Infants, and injuried Orphanes in the Land? the children do not know their right hand from their left, but the Executors do know both their right &amp; their left, to catch, &amp; gripe.

               <p>Firſt, For the gracious enlargement. <hi>And alſo.</hi> God had ſaid much before, but he hath not ſaid all; the expreſſion had been large, and yet God is not at his laſt: if the hard heart of <hi>Jonah</hi> did not yet relent, God will try another ſoftning, he will not keep back an inference, not loſe a motive: no, he hath another clauſe yet behind, <hi>And alſo.</hi> From hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That <hi>God will conceal nothing which may tend to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Saints. Behold how he loved him,</hi> Joh. 11.36. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how God doth value theſe! he doth favour them, and there is no end of his affection; as he hath never looked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon them, ſo he hath never ſpoken enough for them; they ſhall have his Narration, and his amplification, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement. As <hi>Eliſha</hi> had never ſaid enough in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Eliah, My Father, my Father, the Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof,</hi> 2 King. 2.12, So God hath never ſpoken ſufficiently in the defence of his Saints: <hi>My Saints, my Saints, the pleaſure of my my heart, and the parley of my lips. Oh how plentifull is thy goodneſſe which thou haſt laid up in ſtore for them which feare thee,</hi> Pſal. 31.19. So, how plentifull is his patronage? as God reneweth, and <hi>giveth more grace,</hi> Jam. 4.6. So he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and giveth more arguments. He will not onely appeare in the caſe of the Saints, but he will <hi>maintain their cauſe,</hi> 1 King. 8.45. never ſhut up his lips, till he hath convinced, evinced, brought off his Saints clear and innocent; as it is a point or his mercy to take his Saints into his favour, ſo he accounteth it a point of his honour not to ſee them foyled: <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, That <hi>his moras had upholden them which were fallen,</hi> Job 4.4. So Gods words do uphold the faithfull in their moſt ſhaking and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering condition. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was very deſirous to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Cn.

but he ſaid that his caſe was extorted out of his hands by the Oratory of <hi>C. Cotta:</hi> ſo God will ſo argue for his Saints, that he will wreſt them out of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96669:162"/>hands of their enemies; God will look over his papers to find out new proofs, he will ſearch all his Records, examine all his evidences, bring in all his witneſſes, inſiſt upon all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to acquit the faithful. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> If they do, they ſhall have part of their charge anſwered, and more added then they can reply to; he will handle every weapon, rather then he will not fight out their ſafety, he will make all the ſtars in Heaven to ſhine, rather than they ſhould want light in their defence: As our Saviour never left writing on the ground, till the accuſed woman was freed; ſo God will never leave urging of reaſons, till the criminated Saints be abſolved. <hi>Lucius Cotta</hi> had his caſe ſeven times heard in the Court,

and he was not diſcharged, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate would not give over, but made the eighth motion; and then he was releaſed.

No, I defy her, I would draw thee to abhor her: know, who I am, take notice, what ſhe is; I am <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee, ſhe is <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the ſinner; I am thy Feaſt-maker, I ſtand upon the honour of my table, we do not uſe to have ſuch perſons preſent at our Banquets, no, not to look upon us when we are eating; we Phariſees are ſtrict perſons, we cannot endure a ſinner to be in our ſight, much leſſe to come within our walls; if thou didſt valew me, as I have honoured thee, thou wouldſt have tendered the honour of my calling, and the reverence of my perſonage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; I am another manner of man then thou doſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,

What a Prophet, and no better skill'd in perſons? a Prophet, and no more ſenſible of a ſinner? no, either the world is deceived in thee, or thou doſt wonderfully miſtake thy ſelf; thou beareſt a great name, but thou doſt not ſatisfie my expectation; the times cry thee up, but I ſuſpect thee; ſuch a Creature could not but have been inſtantly diſcern'd by a Prophet: <hi>If thou wert a Prophet, thou wouldſt have known, who it was that touched thee.</hi> But perhaps Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets know not all things; but, when they are told, they will not continue to do thoſe things which are diſhonourable to their Miſſion; therefore I in form thee, and aſſure thee by the ſanctity of a Phariſee, that this woman is a ſinner, ſuch an one as ſhall not come nigh to the back of a Phariſee, nor ſhall not touch the feet of an holy Phariſee. Well, thus far the Phariſee hath helped the Prophet, ſhall not the Phariſee, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet now agree in the ſame concluſion? yes, as I am a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and thou art a Prophet; ſo let us get the place cleared of this ſcandalous perſon: away with her, ſend her forth, haſten her over the threſhold, ſhe is my ſcorn, and let her be thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration, even becauſe I am a pure Phariſee, and thou art a reverend Prophet; drive her from thy back, chaſe her from thy feet, expell her out of the houſe, let us be quit of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> free of the ſinner; or elſe, as great a Prophet as thou ſeemeſt to be; I ſhall count the Phariſee the wiſer, and the holier man; but ſend away this woman, and the men ſhall accord well enough; the Phariſee and the Prophet ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſagreee. Well, the buſineſſe is now brought as high, as may be, but the Phariſee muſt not ſpeak all, the Prophet may have leave to ſpeak for himſelf. Wilt thou then, oh thou Phariſee ſeem to inform a Prophet? or judge a Prophet? then thou art a malicious Informer, and an audacious Judge, thou ſeemeſt to have told me much, and I tell thee thus much, that I not only know the woman, but I know thee.

Count me therefore no longer ignorant, no, not concerning this woman, I knew
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96669:163"/>her before ſhe ſet the firſt ſtep towards me, before ſhe ſtood at my back, before ſhe gave the firſt touch to my feet. Thou calleſt her ſinner, and now I ſee that I am at a Phariſee's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for cenſure muſt be one Diſh at the banquet; if a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſce ſhould not be traducing, his tongue would drop out of his head; Is ſhe a ſinner? No, ſhe was a ſinner, but ſhe is not a ſinner, for thou haſt ſeen her tears, didſt thou ever ſhed the like? Oh that thou couldſt! but thou canſt reproach, thou canſt not weep; thou art fuller of ſcandall than remorſe, thou haſt ſins, and thou art ſilent and ſecure, thou doſt fancy; ſhe hath ſins, and ſhe is contrite, penitent, ſhe doth weep; Oh that thou ſhouldeſt think that the ſacrifice ſhould not appeaſe, that ſo many teares ſhould not expiated all her guilts. What, humbled, and yet deſiled? a Mourner, and yet a ſinner? this is another trick of a Phariſee to revive ſins, when they are buried in repentance, ſtill to call ſinner, when thou behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt teares; when will hypocriſie be reconciled to compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? When ſhall a ſinner, though never ſo deploring, get his pardon from a Phariſees lips? No, he is ſtill caſting the old filth in the face, and preſenting the old ſpots, when he viſibly perceives the nitre w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath ſcoured themout; they which live in all manner of ſins, are the moſt eager cenſurers of other mens former ſins; they never talk of their teares, but their crimes; not of their preſent reformation, but their precedent exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies, to magnifie themſelves, they vilifie others, and to extoll their own ſeeming virtues, they run deſcant upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers crucified ſins, and this is juſt the implacable Profeſſor, right the Phariſee. But oh <hi>Simon,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, if thou wext any religious perſon, if thou wert any thing but a Phariſee, thou wouldeſt ſhut up thy mouth, or waſh it; thou wouldeſt burn thy black book, keepe it claſped, caſt it aſide, or raſe out all the gilt-marks which thou haſt fixed in it. Indeed if this woman had come-in, painted, powdred, curled, or brought her old ſwarratters at her heeles, thou hadſt had juſt cauſe ſo to ſtyle her, but when ſhe doth come in, like one that is a loathing to her ſelfe, torn in pieces with remorſe, tortured with conflicts, full of anguiſh and agony, ſkalt in the flames of hell as it were, and pained as much with the ſenſe of ſin, as ever ſhe was with the fangs and claws of the ſeven Devills, which were in her; ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, wailing, weeping, as if ſhe would cleave her heart, chink her breſt, fret off the skin from her eye-lids with hot and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh water, not ſpeaking a word, as if the aſtoniſhment of ſin hand ſtrook her dumb, ſtanding at my back, as if ſhe were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to look me in the face, lying grove-long at my feet, as if dejection of ſpirit had ſo far abaſed her, that ſhe thought
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96669:164"/>her ſelfe fit for nothing but to be trampled upon; yea, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my ſeet, and anointing my feet, as if ſhe would eſteem it an high favour if ſhe might be honoured to lay her penitent lips to my feet, and a pledge of her acceptance, if I will but vouchſafe her (who hath given me the ſweeteſt odour ſhe is owner of, even her fragrant ſoul) to powre a box of coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spikenard upon my meaneſt parts, even my feet; I ſay, if all theſe things were conſidered, thou wouldeſt have another eſtimation of her, change thy opinion concerning her, give her a better title: She the ſinner? no, thou the ſinner; not ſhe the ſinner, which hath lived ſo vitiouſly; but thou the ſinner, which doſt judge ſo uncharitably. What doſt ſee? a woman ſo altered, transformed, which hath bluſhed out all her ſhame, and wept out all her filth, and thruſt all her ſins behind her in ſtanding at my back, and trampled upon all her errours in falling down at my feet, and taken away the ſent of all her luſts, by powring out this ſweet ointment; ſhall ſhe ſtill be a blemiſh, an ignominy, an abomination, a Sinner? Oh it is a miracle I ſee, for <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs of ſpeak, for a Phariſee to bray out any thing but ſinner, they muſt be your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, or elſe they are no Converts; they muſt have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of your own ſynagogues, or elſe they have the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of your tongues; not this people which know not the Law, but this people which know not your Orders, are curſed; ye unhallow all which have not your conſecration, and damn all which are not intialed into ſalvation by your ſuperſtitions and traditions; ſharp prickles will never off from the Porkupines back, nor rank venome out of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers jaws, nor the calling of ſinner out of the Phariſee's lips. But if thou hadſt either judgement, or charity, or piety, thou wouldeſt leave this Synagogue-barbariſm, thou wouldeſt give over thy Phariſees Dialect. For what canſt deſire more to make a child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then ſuch fruit? ſo many tears, ſo much humility, ſo much abnegation and renuntiation, terrour, conſternation, proſtration, do not theſe diſcover a true mortified ſpirit? amongſt all the Proſelytes and Rabbies, didſt ever ſee ſuch a compleat Convert I ſpeak no more of her crimes therefore, leſt thou doſt diſparage thy judgement; mention not againe any of her former guilts, leaſt thou doſt forfeit thy conſcience. She is not <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the ſinner, but <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the penitent; not <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the Saint; yea, a famous, ſplendid, eminent, glorious Saint; thou maiſt be St <hi>Simon</hi> in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue but ſhe is St <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> at my back, and my feet. Look upon her, obſerve her, admire her; here are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but who ſo worthy? here are many gueſts, but who ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous?
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96669:164"/>If thou wert any thing but a Phariſee, it would be a pleaſure to thee, to behold her, yea a trance, a raviſhment, to fix thine eye upon her, every caſt of her countenance is regeneration; every part about her, and poſture which doth come from her, doth ſpeak heaven: ſhe is the honour of the meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ornament of the feaſt, neither I hou, nor thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cheere, nor thy gueſts, do ſo much affect me as the ſight of this matchleſſe Convert; No, I am now welcomed, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> hath given me the entertainment. I had but one invitement, but I meet with a double feaſt: the Phariſee hath feaſted me, the Penitent hath feaſted me, which ſhall go for the banquet? thou haſt been at great charge, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> doth ſerve up all her diſhes in her eyes; thou wouldeſt think much, that a few dumb geſtures, warm drops of a womans diſtilling, and a little box of Spikenard ſhould be preferred before thy ſumptuous fare; I know that all this thinking, and ſpeaking in thy ſelfe, and hard cenſure againſt the ſinner, is that thy proviſion, or thy piety, might be moſt prized. A Phariſee doth love to appropriate all to himſeife, to engroſs reputation, to monopolize praiſe, his perſon muſt have the vogue, and his actions the cry; he muſt be looked upon with a diſtinguiſhing eye, and ſpoken of with a diſcriminating tongue, no wares muſt be of prize, when he doth open his pack, nor no inſtrument make good muſick, when his Cornet doth blow, or his Cymball doth tinckle; no, he muſt be the man of fame, the man alone. Therefore the great queſtion now will be, which way the ſeales of the ballance will bend, who ſhall be adjudged to have moſt graynes of reputation; that doubt will ſoon be reſolved, if every thing be meaſured and poyſed according to the weights of affiction: Who then hath loved me moſt? <hi>Simon, or Mary Magdalen?</hi> The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doubt muſt be determined by the ſuperiority of reſpect; the moſt affectionate perſon, muſt be the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared perſon.

No, I doubt thou haſt beheld her all this while with the Phariſee's eye. For feare therefore that thou ſhouldeſt wrong her with thine eye, though ſhe hath all this while ſtood at my back, yet I will now turn my face upon her, take a ſight of her: yea, I look, and look thou again, take a better view of her. <hi>Seeſt thou this woman? this woman?</hi> this rare, precious, peerleſſe woman? thou lookeſt for high praiſe for thy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and I praiſe thee, but thou muſt not except equall thanks, or honour with this woman: no, thou haſt ſpread thy Table, but <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is the Feaſt-maker. Her water, and napkin and kiſs, and oyntment, far exceed the variety of Diſhes which thou haſt prepared. So that the <hi>Penitent</hi> with Chriſt, doth carry the credit from the Preciſian: <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> hath more commendation from the Saviours lips, then the Phariſee; and the Phariſee it ſeemeth thought ſo: for as a man convinced, after Chriſt had expreſſed the inequality, he doth make no replication. The Phariſee is ſilenced, and now our Saviour doth continue his diſcourſe, he doth leave the Phariſee, and enter into parley with the woman: yea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96669:166"/>we do not find that he juſtified the Phariſee, but doth leave him to his Synagogue balſomes: this woman hath what ſhe doth come for, ſhe is paid for her water, and napkin, and kiſſe, and oyntment. Woman ſtand up, ſtand forth, thou haſt given me water, and I rinſe thee; thou haſt wiped me, and I ſpunge thee; thou haſt kiſſed my feet, and I ſet my Saviours lips to thy ſoul; thou haſt annointed me, and I perfume thy ſpirit, thou cameſt a ſinner, but I will not ſend thee away a ſinner: no, thou haſt ſeen thy laſt minutes of a ſinner. <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven,</hi> Luk. 7.48. And whereas there are new mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers ariſe, that after the Phariſee hath left muttering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, there are others that ſay in themſelves, a cavilling generation, which had learned their ſpirit of contradiction from their old oppoſing Maſter; that when he had laid down his weapons, they renew the aſſault, being loath that the woman ſhould go away without her old name, the Sinner; traducing Chriſt, that he ſhould dare to abſolve her. For <hi>they that ſat at meat with him, began to ſay within themſelves, Who is this, that forgiveth ſins alſo?</hi> v. 49. That the woman might not be troubled with this interpoſition and alteration, Chriſt doth renew his authorizing grant, putting another ſeal to the pardon. For he ſaid to the woman, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace,</hi> v. 50. So that the woman now is cleared and diſcharged, forgiven and ſaved: Oh gracious Saviour! oh bleſſed <hi>Mary Magdalen!</hi> All this long diſcourſe have I uſed, that by one full inſtance ye might ſee, when God is pleaſed to ſhew mercy, he will find out all the incentives that may conduce to compaſſion, a here ye ſee, that God omitteth nothing that might bring off this penitent creature with honour; there is not onely an aſſertion that ſhe was worthy, but here is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, a large diſpute about it, Chriſt hath a gradation of arguments for her. And is it not ſo here in my Text? Yes, there was a diſcuſſion, and an enforcement, that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was to be ſpared, becauſe it was a City, a great City, that great City, and that great City which hath things of price in it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and their multitudes, and ſurpluſage mentioned, that they had ſixſcore thouſand and more; and their diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they cannot; and in a thing of the higheſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that they cannot diſcern; and not for intricate things, but for common, triviall things, they cannot diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their right hand and their left; and, leſt all this ſhould be too little, that the ſparing grace ſhould not be condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to; God, if he hath not ſaid enough, he will ſay more, adds to the affirmation a confirmation and to the enforcement an enlargement. <hi>And alſo Should not I ſpare Nineth that great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein are more than ſixſcore thouſand perſons, which cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

Oh then that mercy is thus dear unto God, and not ſo precious unto us; that we deſire any thing in God rather then his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; we would have his wiſdom perhaps, or his power, and if we could, his glory, and eternity, but we care not for his mercy. What affections do there glow in us towards mercy? what motions have we made for mercy? what preparations are we qualified with for entertainment of mercy? no, this Mannah, this Angels food is light bread in our eſteems, we will not ſtep out of our Tents to gather a gomer full of it. <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple refuſe the waters of Shiloah which run ſoftly,</hi> Eſa. 8.6.

Oh that the Goſpell revealed, doth not teach you more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; that judgement denounced, doth not quicken you to more integrity? Will ye diſſemble to the laſt? and jeopard
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96669:182"/>the ruine of a whole City in your out-ſide cleanſings?

How farre can ye imagine, that ye are off from the colliſions of juſtice? every corner of your City doth ſeem to tremble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the voyce of a threatning God. Oh your ſinnes do cry, and vengeance is awakned with the noyſe of them, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are offended with you, and the earth doth ſeem to riſe up in tumults amongſt you; your courſes have been ſuch, that moſt do defy you, and few do pitty you; there are many which do wiſh your deſtruction, and are ſorry that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make you the miſerable of the earth; they conſult ſad things concerning you, yea conſpire againſt you night and day; their braines doe work, their hearts do boyle, their mouthes do foam, and they would willingly be ſtretching out their hands to ſhake you, and ſhiver you; ye have e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

How can ye oppoſe ſuch irreſiſtible forces? no, though ye had guards of Giants, and every common Souldier were an <hi>Aſhibenoh,</hi> (the head of whoſe ſpear weighd three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhekels of braſs) yet your ſinnes will beat you down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your enemies. Oh ſtand up in your own defence, open the right Arſenall; <hi>Have the armour of righteouſneſſe on the right hand, and on the leſt;</hi> uſe <hi>Ninevehs</hi> weapons to ſight this battel vanquiſh all your ſinnes by crying lowder for mercy, then they do for ruine; eſcape vengeance by flying from your provocations, before indignation hath attached you; your City is threatned, take heed ye do not ſleep out the hour of your ſecurity. Preſumption may ſubvert, let contrition deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you: the time may be ſhort, the work is great, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is apparent, the miſery will be unſpeakable; lay aſide, neglect, awaken from torpulency, pluck down your haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, ſurceaſe from obſtinacy: your City walls do ſhake, let your hearts ſhake; your buildings are looſe upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, groundſell them better by mortification: all your goods are ready to be ſacrificed to vengeance, bring forth your ſin offering before the ſparks have taken fire: if there be in you any liſtning to a warning, credence of threatning, obedience to counſail, foreſight of danger, ſting of guilt, or obligation of duty: pitty the City, and petition for the City, ſhed lakes of teares to obtaine the peace of the City, kill droves of ſins to procure the ſafety of the City; wear ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth leaſt ye do go naked; faſt leaſt ye do ſtarve; ſit upon the aſh-heap, leaſt ye be brought to an aſh-heap; creep upon your knees, leaſt ye do creep into corners, ſhut up your ſelves into

Thus, if I can now leave you with bleeding hearts, ſobbing breaſts, ſuppliant tongues, abaſed bodies, frayed ſouls, purified conſciences, and rinſed converſations; ye are <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and your City may yet proſper. For ye ſee how God pleaded out his caſe for <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and freed his Clyent, the City was humbled and preſerved, repentance prevented her over-throw; not a man was ſmitten, though there were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Perſons;</hi> not a beaſt was deſtroyed, though there were <hi>much cattle. Go, and do thou likewiſe;</hi> do likewiſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy likewiſe. Oh that I could be ſuch a <hi>Jonah</hi> to you! that I could cry out, ſuch a City! that I could make you thus to believe God, and ſerve God; your humiliation ſhould free you from all horrors, your dejection from all dangers, your devotion and reformation from all exigents; your walles ſhould not be battered, your Bulwarks not demoliſhed, your Palaces ſhould not be laid waſt, your Temples ſhould not be ſhut up, your ſhops ſhould not be rifled, your perſons ſhould not be maſſacred, nor your Cattle ſlaughtered; but your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, your Lives, your Goods, your Royalties, your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, your Oracles, your holy Altars, holy Prieſts, holy Veſſels, holy Shew-bread, holy Incenſe, and Holy of Holies; even all your ſpiritual prerogatives, and Church-priviledges, ſhould be ratified to you upon earth, ye ſhould continue a ſafe people, and flouriſhing City; yea, after ye had ſerved God in his Church, ye ſhould ſerve him in his Temple; he ſhould tranſlate you from this City, to the City of the new Jeruſalem, that after ye had enjoyed all the preferments of the materiall, or myſticall City, ye might have the joyes and pleaſures of the glorious City, even the <hi>prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Which that ye may have, the Lord grant for his mercies ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
